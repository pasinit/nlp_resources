Give me a break. If the Mormons fortified Utah and armed it to the teeth,
and were involved in illegal activity, then they deserve whatever they get.
Where were you brought up? In the former USSR? Is Innocent until proven
guilty by a jury of your peers, NOT Dan Rather, dead in this country? Seems
so. Is tax evasion, the only charge brought against the BDs, punishable by
death in this country, now?
You are making a ludicrous suggestion.
Not really. You are a blind idiot.

Does that include the right to murder little children? How about killing
ATF officers? I do not know much about the gun laws in Texas, but
Koresh's folks claimed to have grenades, grenade launchers, and rocket
launchers. I am not sure that the NRA feels that this falls under
"right to bear arms."
"Not sure", yet you condem them to death for it? If the BATF had stayed home,
all would be alive, now. So who murdered who?

Please explain. I do not remember Jews or Mormons (as a group) overtly
breaking a judicious (a.k.a. non-Nazi) law and being punished for it.
You have a short memory.

Sleep well, tonite, heartless idiot. Sleep the sleep of the simple-minded.

I'm short of patience tonite, but rabid dogs deserve and get better treatment
than the BDs got.
