In article <>, > Christian: washed in
the blood of the lamb.
Mithraist: washed in the blood of the bull.
If anyone in .netland is in the process of devising a new religion,
do not use the lamb or the bull, because they have already been
reserved. Please choose another animal, preferably one not
on the Endangered Species List.
This will be a hard task, because most cultures used most animals
for blood sacrifices. It has to be something related to our current
post-modernism state. Hmm, what about used computers?
Cheers,
Kent
