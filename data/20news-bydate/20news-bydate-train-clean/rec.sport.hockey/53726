I saw yesterday on TV a game between Team Sweden and Team Finland.
Most of us might know that it was played in Stockholm and the result
was 4:3 for the home team. That's nothing very special. But I was
very surprised of Saku Koivu. I must admit that he surprised me
already in the Finnish playoffs. And now on team Finland!
Saku Koivu is a light weight player, if we consider his size: According
to my stats he is only 172cm and 68kgs! And he is only 18! (23.11.74).
But he is a real two-way player! Skates well, can score, gives nice
passes, does even bodycheckings!!? He is really something to watch
in the WC.
The size isn't always everything. Maybe we remember Harlamov.
And they say that Saku is still growing up (3cm during last year).
Saku isn't that small any longer I guess I heard he is 177cm tall at the
