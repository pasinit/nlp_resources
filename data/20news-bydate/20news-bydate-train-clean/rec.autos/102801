This is why I think there ought to be a heavy fine on false alarms.
I'm really honked off about the fact that due to all the
cars with cruddy alarms crying "wolf", no one will pay any attention
to my car if its alarm ever goes off for real.
Depends on your area, in the city, nobody thinks about it.but at a mall or
something near the suburbs, people do at least glance over. Remember, an
alarm is only a deterent, not a prevention. If a thief sees two cars he
"likes", one has an alarm and the other doesn't, he's obviously going to skip
the alarmed car and avoid the hassle. There is a way around every alarm, but
at least you've got SOMETHING on your side.
