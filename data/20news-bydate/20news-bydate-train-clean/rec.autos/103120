Before the S4 became the S4 it was called the 200 turbo quattro 20v.
This model did come in a wagon, a very quick wagon. Very rare also.

Yes, I saw a 200 Turbo Quattro wagon on I-287 in NJ on Monday. I thought
Audi stopped selling wagons in the US after the 5000. This is exactly the
type of vehicle I would like to own. I bet its price is 4-5 times my
car budget.
