Why do spacecraft have to be shut off after funding cuts. For
example, Why couldn't Magellan just be told to go into a "safe"
mode and stay bobbing about Venus in a low-power-use mode and if
maybe in a few years if funding gets restored after the economy
gets better (hopefully), it could be turned on again.
It can be, but the problem is a political one, not a technical one.
