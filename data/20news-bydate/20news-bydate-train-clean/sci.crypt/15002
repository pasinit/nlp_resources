You've overlooked a fundamental Truth:
both headcount and budget of any government agency are
monotonic increasing functions.
Given that Truth, you need to look for what the agency can do to occupy
all those people and spend all that money when crypto is unbreakable.
Perhaps they could talk the world's telephone companies into making equipment
they could break into and tap.
Maybe they could convince people that distributed computing was a good idea
so that even the internal state of a process would be available for access
by wiretapping.
Maybe.
