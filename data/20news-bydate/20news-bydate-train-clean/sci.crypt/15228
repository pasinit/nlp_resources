FACT: It is unlawful to distribute code implementing RSA without a license

any use of RSA, other than for research purposes allowed under US patent
law, is similarly unlawful. Therefore, the "average citizen" cannot use
RSA to encrypt message traffic in the US without a license from PKP.
WRONG: I don't think even PKP claims this one. It is not unlawful to
distribute code implementing RSA. It appears to be unlawful to use it, so
I agree with your last sentence.
FACT: There are no restrictions (yet!) on the use of cryptography under
US law, although this is beginning to look like it will change. The only
impediments to widespread use of RSA cryptography in the US are PKP's
patents.
Yes, that's correct.
