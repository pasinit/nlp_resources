Sure you can buy a TEMPEST approved Mac -- if you have enough
money. I haven't had any reason to look at this type of pricing
for about 10 years, but a TEMPEST rating in 1982 would raise the
price of a $2,495.00 Radio Shack Model III to something around
$15,000.00.
Or just dig a deep enough hole in the ground. 50 feet should do it.
