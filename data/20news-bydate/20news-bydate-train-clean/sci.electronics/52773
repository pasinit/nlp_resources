I've been wanting to build a Tesla coil for quite awhile now (
who doesn't, right? ) and I thought it would be a good intermidiate

Well, I have been looking for a high voltage transformer that
is reasonable inexpensive ( neon sign transformers cost mucho ).
In the past I've managed to buy used neon sign transformers from sign shops
for about $20. Try calling around.
