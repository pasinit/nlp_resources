Why was the "Zephyr" discontinued? I heard something about a problem with
the name, but I never did hear anything certain.
I don't think the 550 sold very well - most North Americans who ride a standard

dealership, look at the 550 and the 750 and say, "I might as well spring the
extra bucks for the bigger engine."
