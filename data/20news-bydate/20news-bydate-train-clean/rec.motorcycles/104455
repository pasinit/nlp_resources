Yes, my front tire is all but dead. It has minimal tread left, so it's
time for a new one. Any recommendations on a good tire in front? I'm
riding on an almost brand new ME55A in back.
Stick an ME33 on the front. I've got a Laser on the front of my GPz,
and it has been a fantastic tire. Best front tire I've ever had.
