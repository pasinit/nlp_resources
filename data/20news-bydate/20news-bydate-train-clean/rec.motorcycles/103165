I am looking for advice on what bikes I should check out. I
am 6'4" tall, and find my legs/hips uncomfortably bent on most of
the bikes I have ridden (not many admittedly). Are there any bikes
out there built for a taller rider?
There's plenty of legroom on the Kawasaki KLR650. A bit
short in the braking department for spirited street riding,
but enough for dirt and for less-agressive street stuff.
