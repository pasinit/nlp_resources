Can someone recommend how to ship a motorcycle from San Francisco
to Seattle? And how much might it cost?
I'd recommend that you hop on the back of it and cruise - that's a
really nice ride, if you choose your route with any care at all.
Shouldn't cost more than about $30 in gas, and maybe a night's motel
bill.
