Has anyone used a Hercules Graphite adapter? It looks good on paper, and
Steve Gibson gave it a very good review in Infoworld. I'd love to get a
real-world impression, though -- how is the speed? Drivers? Support?
The PC World reviewers found out that the Herc people had hard-coded
Winbench text into the driver. Clever, no? In any case, the Winbench
results are pretty much inflated.
When and if you get one send me mail. I might buy that ATI GU+ off
you. 9-)
