Unless I am completely misunderstanding you, try using either Notepad or
sysedit.exe (found in your system subdirectory) to edit you .ini files.
You can add sysedit (& regedit) to a program group. they are Windows
programs.
The sysedit.exe program is cool because it automatically opens you win.ini,
system.ini, autoexec.bat and config.sys files to be edited.
Is it possible to get it to load other *.ini files ????
