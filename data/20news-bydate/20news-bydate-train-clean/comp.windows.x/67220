Sorry, but olwm and tvtwm don't do it. They place the title at that position
and the window at a position below it.
This becomes a problem when you want a program to be able to save its current
configuration and restore is later.
Currently, my solution is:
XCreateWindow(.);
XSetWMProperties(.);
XMapWindow(.);
XFlush(.);
XMoveWindow(.);
It works with olwm, but is less than elegant. All this leaves me wondering
if I'm overlooking something obvious.

I know that the mwm has an resource to specify if positions are to be used for
the border of a window or for the "user" window. Maybe other window managers
have similar options.
Another way to figure out the difference between the "user" window position
