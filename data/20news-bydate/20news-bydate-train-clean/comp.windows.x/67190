I have a problem when I'm using PostScript. When I am working local
on a SUN SPARCstation IPC the PostScript works good, but when I connect
to the SUN from a X-terminal I just get error messages that the
PostScript cannot connect to the news-display.
Why doesn't PostScript work on an X-terminal
Because xterminals do not have a NeWS server. xterminals have
speed by nature of their limited functionality: once you add NeWS and
everything else, you have a workstation. There are workarounds, I've
heard, one involving a perl script. What we are trying to do is
replace programs that need NeWS (like pageview) with programs that
don't (like ghostview).
Maybe someone else can elaborate on the perl workaround; I
have no personal experience with it.
