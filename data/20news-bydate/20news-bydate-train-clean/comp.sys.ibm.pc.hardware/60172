* Attention voters:
*
* I had a problem with my mailbox on the first day of voting.
* Please check the Vote Acknowlegement (ACK) at the end of this CFV.
* If your name/address is not there, please send your vote again.
* (Actually, check even if you voted after the first day)
Introduction:
This is the third (and final) Call For Votes (CFV) for the creation
of four OS/2 newsgroups and the renaming of one:
(a) create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting (unmoderated)
(b) renaming of comp.os.os2.programmer to
comp.os.os2.programmer.misc (unmoderated)
(c) comp.os.os2.setup (unmoderated)
(d) comp.os.os2.multimedia (unmoderated)
(e) comp.os.os2.bugs (unmoderated)
This is the second attempt at creating comp.os.os2.programmer.porting
and comp.os.os2.setup, and renaming comp.os.os2.programmer to
comp.os.os2.programmer.misc. The first attempt failed in the summer
of 1992 (the voting deadline was August 31, 1992). The voting rules
state that another attempt for creating newsgroups can be started
after a six month waiting period (in this case, it is March 1, 1993).
This is the first attempt at creating comp.os.os2.multimedia and
comp.os.os2.bugs.
This document contains:
* the background showing the need for these proposals
* the proposed charters for these proposals
* voting instructions
* a voting ballot
* some example ballots
* the voting rules
* the voting schedule
* the Mass Acknowledgement
Background:
The creation of two, free, 32-bit compilers for OS/2 2.x (gcc/2
and emx/gcc; read comp.os.os2.programmer for details) has spurred
a continuing deluge of software ported from UNIX platforms, such
as emacs, less, awk, grep, sed, xscheme, ispell, flex, yacc, and
much more. Borland has released its C/C++ compiler for OS/2 2.x,
allowing for easier porting of DOS and Windows software.
Much of the PC hardware and drivers were written for DOS, and
later, Windows. As more people are discovering OS/2 2.x, the
number of people asking questions about OS/2's compatibility
with their hardware increases, as does the questions on the
availability of drivers for their hardware, installation
procedures, etc.
Multimedia is becoming popular. OS/2 2.0 supports Windows
Multimedia Extensions using Win-OS/2 3.0. Furthermore, IBM is
including direct multimedia support in OS/2 starting with version
2.1 (in addition to using Win-OS/2 3.1).
Any non-trivial software will have bugs -- OS/2 is not exempt,
especially since IBM is constantly adding new features to OS/2.
So far, IBM has issued system patches and corrective service disks
(e.g. the Service Pak) for free (free from BBSs and ftp sites, or
for free plus a small media charge for diskettes -- read
comp.os.os2.misc for details).
Proposed Charters:
(a) create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting (unmoderated)
It will provide a forum for developers of ported software so
as to coordinate efforts, avoid duplication of effort, and
spur additional development. The group will also cover
topics such as porting from other platforms (such as DOS,
Windows, UNIX, etc), toolkits which aid in program
portability (including porting tools such as Mirrors), and
so forth.
(b) rename: comp.os.os2.programmer.misc (unmoderated)
To keep the structure of the OS/2 newsgroup heirarchy
orthogonal, comp.os.os2.programmer should be renamed to
comp.os.os2.programmer.misc.
comp.os.os2.programmer.misc will still be the newsgroup
for OS/2 programmers to discuss programming issues and
technical aspects of OS/2 in an unmoderated setting.
(c) create comp.os.os2.setup (unmoderated)
It will be devoted to OS/2 system setup topics, including the
availability of device drivers, compatibility information,
installation procedures, system requirements, and overall
performance optimization.
(d) create comp.os.os2.multimedia (unmoderated)
It will provide a forum for discussion of multi-media issues.
(e) create comp.os.os2.bugs (unmoderated)
It will provide a forum for OS/2 system bug reports, bug
diagnosis and work arounds, the availability of system
patches and corrective service disks, and so forth.
[Note that discussion of bugs in applications belong in other
newsgroups, and discussion of bugs in OS/2 betas belong in
comp.os.os2.beta]
How to Vote:
To cast your vote, fill out the ballot below and e-mail it to me.
Many newsreaders will allow e-mail to be sent by replying to this
post. Be sure to send only the ballot, and edit out the rest of
this post.
1) Type in your vote for each proposal:
If you favor the charter as proposed, put a "yes" after its name.
If you oppose the charter as proposed, put a "no" after its name.
To abstain, leave a blank after its name.
2) Type in your last name (i.e. your family name), a comma, and
your first name (i.e. your personal name).
3) Cut out the ballot, Please do not delete any lines of the
ballot.
4) E-mail your ballot to before 11:59:59 pm
(Central Time), April 24, 1993.
Ballot:

comp.os.os2.programmer.misc. He also opposes the creation of
comp.os.os2.setup and comp.os.os2.bugs. He does not have a view
on the creation of comp.os.os2.multimedia.
Example Ballot #2:
(a) comp.os.os2.programmer.porting: yes
(b) comp.os.os2.programmer.misc: yes

Voting Rules:
* One vote per person. If you vote more than once, only the most
recent vote will be counted.
* Votes must be mailed to me by the person voting. Proxy voting,
forwarding, posting votes to a newsgroup, etc. will not be counted.
* Do not ask how the votes are going. The status of the votings
will be revealed only after the poll closes.
* I will acknowledge votes by Mass Acknowledgement (ACK). I will
post the ACK twice (see Schedule below).
* If you need help for using your editor, using e-mail, how
voting works in general, etc. then ask an expert at your site.
Also see the ``How To Create a New Newsgroup'' article which is
posted to news.answers on a regular basis.
* If you need any clarifications on voting procedures for this
CFV, send me e-mail at
* When the voting period is over (see Schedule below), a proposal
passes if both of the following formulas are true:
1) the number of YES votes exceeds the number of NO votes
by at least 100 (i.e. YES >= NO + 100, or YES - NO >= 100).
2) the number of YES votes exceeds at least twice the
number of NO votes (i.e. YES >= 2 * NO, or YES - NO >= NO).
In other words, a proposal passes if:
YES - NO >= max (100, NO)
where max() returns the highest number given to it.
Schedule:
The voting period started on March 29 when the first CFV was posted
by David Lawrence (the news.announce.newgroups moderator).
This third CFV is a repeat of the first CFV, but it also has the
Mass Acknowledgement (ACK) of names and e-mail addresses of those who
have already voted -- re-send your vote if it is not there. If you
have not voted yet, vote now!
The voting period will end at 11:59:59 pm (Central Time), on
April 24, 1993. Votes received after that time will not count.
The voting results and tally will be posted shortly after that
date.
