I ask myself, what law could we pass to prevent government from doing
stupid, frivilous things with OUR money? Then I think, the Constitution
was supposed to do that. Could someone please tell me what legitimate
constitutional power the federal government is using when it takes money
from my paycheck and gives it to needy countries? Seriously.

Since you asked, Article I Section 1. Article I Section 8. Article I
Section 10. Article II Section 2. Article VI. Sixteenth Amendment.
With this as a guide, try reading it yourself.
