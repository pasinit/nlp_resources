Uh, not quite. The 54/40' boundary dispute is still unresolved,
and Canadian and US Coast Guard vessels regularly if infrequently
detain each other's fish boats in the disputed waters off Dixon
Entrance. The only reason you don't hear more about it is that
it's in neither country's interest to aggravate the quarrel.
That doesn't mean that either country is prepared to back down,
especially the local political representatives whose constituents
are all fishermen.
Fishing rights are disputed. Between 2 nations, no matter *how*
friendly, there is ALWAYS fishing disputes.
What I was getting at was the 54 40' or fight slogan is OLD STUFF
dealing with the LAND dispute. No one is saying 54 40' or fight
about fishing rights. The territorial dispute about the Oregon
Territory (we called it) is LONG resolved.
Fishing rights.small potatoes.
