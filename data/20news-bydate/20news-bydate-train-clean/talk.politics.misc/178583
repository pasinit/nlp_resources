Yeah, yeah, yeah. Anyway, I was under the impression that the Marines
in question invited Clinton down for the same treatment. While a
bar fight is a bar fight, threatening the Commander in Chief seems
a rather unprofessional thing for a professional soldier to do.
Also, it appears that two of the three Marines have some sort of charges
pending against them from another fight they were in a week before.
Interesting.
