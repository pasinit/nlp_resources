I don't find this silly at all. I find it silly (black humor) that we're
spending billions of dollars and risking the lives and freedoms of every
American to save a bunch of by-choice druggies.
Could you please tell us WHY you find this silly. That's, WHY, letters
"W", "H" and "Y", rather than arguments like "oh, _everbody_ thinks such and
such is true".
First, the only drug that could possibly be put in drug stations are marijuana
or its derivitives. Every other drug that I can think of can kill you if you
take to much. (By the very nature of these drugs, your decision making skills
aren't up to par. That is how it differs from asprin, flinstone vitamins, etc.
We don't even allow penicilin to be sold over the counter.)
Second, we already have a big enough drunk driving and alchoholic problem in
this country. If marijuana were legal, undoubtedly more people would use it,
and that IS a problem. People use it, get stupid, and hurt other people.
