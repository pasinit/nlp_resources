The speculum is the little cone that fits on the end of the otoscope.
There are also vaginal specula that females and gynecologists are
all too familiar with.
In fairness, we should note that if you look up "speculum" in the
dictionary (which I did when this question first surfaced), the first
definition is "a mirror or polished metal plate used as a reflector in
optical instruments."
Which doesn't mean the name fits in this context, but it's not as far
off as you might think.
