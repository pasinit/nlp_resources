What about Kekule's infamous derivation of the idea of benzene rings
from a daydream of snakes in the fire biting their tails? Is this
specific enough to count? Certainly it turns up repeatedly in basic
phil. of sci. texts as an example of the inventive component of
hypothesizing.
I sometimes wonder if Kekule's dream wasn't just a wee bit influenced by
aromatic solvent vapors ;-) heh heh.
