This is one of those sticky areas of medicine where battles frequently
rage. With respect to your OB, I suspect that she has been certified in
ultrasound diagnostics, and is thus allowed to use it and bill for its
use. Many cardiologists also use ultrasound (echocardiography), and are
in fact considered by many to be the 'experts'. I am not sure where OBs
stand in this regard, but I suspect that they are at least as good as the
radioligists (flame-retardant suit ready).
If it were my wife, I would insist that a radiologist be involved in the
process. Radiologist are intensively trained in the process of
interpreting diagnostic imaging data and are aware of many things that
other physicians aren't aware of. Would you want a radiologist to
deliver your baby? If you wouldn't, then why would you want a OB/GYN to
read your ultrasound study?
In my opinion the process should involve a OB/GYN and a radiologist.
