[reply to (Derek Abbott)]
Are there any case histories of severe mental illness cases remarkably
recovering after a tragic accident or trauma (eg. through nobody's fault,
being trapped in a fire and losing your legs, say)?
I know of a patient who was severely and chronically depressed and tried
to kill himself with a bullet to the temple. He essentially gave
himself a prefrontal lobotomy, curing the depression.
