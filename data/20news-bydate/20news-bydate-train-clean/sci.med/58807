I certainly can't always avoid it (unless I want to be rude, I suppose).
I made a decision a while back that I will not be bullied into getting
studies like a CT or MRI when I don't think they are indicated. If the
patient won't accept my explanation of why I think the study would be a
waste of time and money, I suggest a second opinion.
