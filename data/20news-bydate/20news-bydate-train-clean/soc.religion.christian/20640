Fortunately, my own personal theology, which will probably not
fall into line with a lot others, recognized God as a being both

a masculine and feminine force.
That is not necessarily unorthodox. When Christians call God 'Father',
we are using a metaphor. The Bible in one place refers to God as being
like a mother. God is neither a father nor a mother in the literal
sense; God has some of the attributes of both; the father metaphor is
usually used because (for most people at most times) it is the less
misleading of the two possibilities.
