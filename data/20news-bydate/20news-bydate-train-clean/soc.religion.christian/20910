Where in the Bible is there *any* teaching about an immaterial afterlife?
I was always taught that both the O.T. Jews and the N.T. Christians would
have found the notion incomprehensible--as do I.
Don't we christians believe in the resurrection of the body?
Or do you mean by material simply the stuff made of the 100+ elements
that we know and love too much?
