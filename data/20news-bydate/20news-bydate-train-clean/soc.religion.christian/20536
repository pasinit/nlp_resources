After all, what does prophesy mean? Secondly, what is an Apostle? Answer:
an especial witness--one who is suppose to be a personal witness. That means
to be a true apostle, one must have Christ appear to them. Now lets see

Actually, an apostle is someone who is sent. If you will, mailmen could
be called apostles in that sense. However, with Jesus, they were
designated and were given power. Remember that there were many
thousands of people who witnessed what Jesus did. That didn't make them
apostles, though.
