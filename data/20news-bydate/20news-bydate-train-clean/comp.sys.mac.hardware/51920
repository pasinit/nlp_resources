Summary: Quadra Clock Chip Swap Success
Keywords: Quadra,clock,accelerate
After reading reports from Germany of success in accelerating a Quadra
or Centris simply by changing the clock oscillator, I decided to test the
claim. I pulled out my Variable Speed Overdrive and the motherboard's
50 mhz clock chip. I put a socket in the clock's place and inserted a
64 mhz TTL clock oscillator I had left over from working on some SI's.
I can't believe it. It actually works. I'm not getting SCSI timing errors
either. This is only after a short run time but I'll keep posting results.
