Hey everybody:
I want to buy a mac and I want to get a good price.who doesn't? So,
could anyone out there who has found a really good deal on a Centris 650
send me the price. I don't want to know where, unless it is mail order or
areound cleveland, Ohio. Also, should I buy now or wait for the Power PC.
Thanks.
BoB
