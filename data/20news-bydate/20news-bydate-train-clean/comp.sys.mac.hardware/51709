I think that there do exist NuBus expansion cages (I'm sure I've seen
them advertised occassionally), but I think that the main problem is that
they cost much more than the difference in price between say a LC and IIvx
so unless you need lots of NuBus slots its not worth the bother.
(Of course, it may be that these extra boxes are so expensive because
no one buys them because they are so expensive.)
NuBus technology isn't a special Apple Proprietry thing (I have this
sneaky feeling that it is licensed from Texas Instruments???) so there
is no problem building an expansion box.
Apple uses the IEEE Nubus-90 standard for their 32 bit backplane bus.
(I got this from a technote that I reada couple of weeks ago)
