Does anyone know how to open up the Apple Ergo-Mouse (ADB Mouse II)? Mine
lives near a cat (true, really.) and picks up her fur. From what I can tell,
it looks like Apple welded it shut.
By rotating the plate around the mouse ball counter-clockwise you can open
the mouse and clean it. It isn't as obvious as the Desktop Bus Mouse I but
it opens quite easily once you see what has to be done.
