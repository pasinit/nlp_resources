First off, if I'm not mistaken, only hibernating animals have brown fat,
not humans.
Human infants do have bown fat deposits while adult humans are
believed not to have brown fat.
Also while brown fat may play an important role in rousing
hibernators, it is definitely not limited to hibernating animals -- it
is a common energy source for nonshivering thermogenesis.
