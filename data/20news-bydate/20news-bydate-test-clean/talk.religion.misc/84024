Nut or not, he was clearly a liar. He said he would surrender after
local radio stations broadcast his message, but he didn't. Then he
said he would surrender after Passover, but he didn't.
The rest of the story seems to be that the agreement for the broadcast
was for prime-time, and that Koresh never even heard it played. Wasn't
even tuned in to the radio when it aired -- so no reason to come out.
If later they had given him a copy of the grossly twisted newswire
transcript -- I'm certain Koresh would think he was at the mercy of
evil itself.
As to coming out after Passover, wasn't that just one of the lawyer's
speculations Peter?
