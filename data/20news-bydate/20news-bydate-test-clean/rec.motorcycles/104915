So you really see no problem with banning them from places to which you
don't want to go?
I have not heard, or discussed with non-motorcycling persons, or read of
any popular movement, either in the country as a whole, or in any of the
states, that is out to 'get' motorcycles.
Talk to somebody in the insurance industry, particularly after a few
drinks. Then talk to my mom (no booze required). :^)
One more thing, if the public is misinformed and misunderstands as you
state, what are you and the others posting on this doing to correct the
situation?
Ever heard of the DoD? :^)
ever since I hit my teens I have found that there were
terrible wrongs to right, attitudes to adust. [blah, blah, blah]
Fortunately, I grew up! :-)
Nah, you just became complacent that so long as your little quarter
acre is safe, you get your little tax deduction, and no act of the
government intrudes, in too direct and obvious a way, into your little
day to day life, you just don't give a shit.
