]I was enjoying lunch this saturday at foodies in Milford NH with an assortment
]of other nedod folks when Dean Cookson ( yes he has not left the
]country, yet) mentioned that the wiring diagram of the VFR750
]shows that the light switch is a three position switch.
]high beam
]low beam
]Both beams
]Well the actual ergonomics of the switch make it appear to be a
]2 position switch, but sure enough as Deam expected , when
]you balance the toggle switch in the center position both the high
]and low beams go on.
]This provides a very nice light coverage of the road.
]This is true for the St11 and the VFR750 and I would expect for any
]other late model Honda with the standard two position light switch.
]Thanks to Dean for reading the schematics, try it you'll like it.
