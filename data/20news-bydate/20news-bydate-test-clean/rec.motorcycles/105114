Well the actual ergonomics of the switch make it appear to be a
2 position switch, but sure enough as Deam expected , when
you balance the toggle switch in the center position both the high
and low beams go on.
This provides a very nice light coverage of the
road.
Hmmmm I noticed sometime ago that I could do the same on my Virago, and
since I don't read many schematics, I didn't really think aobut it too
much. Yes it does provide excellent coverage, but I figured it would
probably draw a little too much current. I also figured that it was
overlapped just to prevent a blank spot of no headlight. Are you saying
that these switches are designed for the hi/lo combination?
