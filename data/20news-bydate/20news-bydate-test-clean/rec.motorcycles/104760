I understand why you theoretically stop so far behind a car but can you
really in actuality avoid such an incident? Suggestions?
An even better strategy is to leave less of a buffer between you and
the car in front, but enough to manuver around it. Keep the bike in
1st gear with the clutch handle squeezed in (how's that for
engaged/disengaged?), until there are two cars stopped behind you.
When the next BDI cager comes screaching in, simply ride up along side
of the car in front of you. You don't need to panic and do it, or you
will pop the clutch and stall the engine. Do is smoothly, just
rapidly. The cage in front of you will provide MUCH better protection
than anything else (particularly empty road).
