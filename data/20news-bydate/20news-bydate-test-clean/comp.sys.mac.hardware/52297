Those chimes indicate a hardware failure of some type during System startup.
One thing that can cause the chimes is a cable that has become a bit loose. Next time you power down the computer, check that all cables are on tight.
I remember a simple program that would play those chimes for you when you
clicked their respective buttons. Does anyone know where that is? This was
circa 1988, I think.
