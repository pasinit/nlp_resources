Well, the obvious point to make is would straight men fuck like rabbits

I reckon *any* *man* would go wildly promiscuous if presented with a
huge variety of willing partners.
If true, and if gays were the same as straights except
for sexual preference, I would imagine that gays would
have much less sex than straights because the available
pool for dates is less than one-tenth what it is for
straights. Somebody correct (flame) me please!
