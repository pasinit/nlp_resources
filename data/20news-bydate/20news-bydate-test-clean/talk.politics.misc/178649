I'm forced to agree with Garrett here. There's no need for vulgarity,
or even hostility. I mean, it's not as though Garrett _asked_ to be born
dumber than a bag of hammers. While it can occasionally be annoying,
there is a noble tragedy to someone with no knowlege of geography or
pre-Madonna history thinking that his political views are worth reading.
Something like a hydroencephalic trying to master nuclear physics.
I was the first to note that the population of the PRC isn't gonna
fit into Cambodia unless you puree them, so there's no need to keep
pounding on that idiocy. There are plenty of other idiocies in his post.
Find your own and stop hogging mine.
At first this kind of ranting annoyed me, but now it's rather entertaining.
These kinds of posts don't require ANY facts, logic, or even sense. It's
kind of like what 10-year old kids do on the playground. So go on and play.
Not everyone on the net is as simple minded as you guys seem to be.
