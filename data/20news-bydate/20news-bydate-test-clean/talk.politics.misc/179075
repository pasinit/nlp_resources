Just look at the history of Koresh and his folowers. They captured
the Mount Carmel complex a few yearss ago in a gun battle with a
rival BD sect, leaving more than one person dead. They weren't
exactly the most peace loving bunch.
Koresh & some of his followers were tried and found *innocent* of
all charges following that shootout. Were you unaware of this or
did you purposly leave out this fact?
