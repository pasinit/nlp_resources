As has already been pointed out, the Jews faced a totally
different fate at the hand of the Romans than did Koresh
at the hand of the feds. The Jewish men would most likely
have been crucified, the the women and children sold into
slavery. One can well argue that Koresh may have *thought*
that a similar fate awaited him, but there was scant rational
basis for that fear, so "insane" seems to describe any such
belief.
What is the penalty if convicted of murdering 4 Federal agents
in Texas? The death penalty.
None of which excuses the reckless action of the feds, who
allegedly believing they were dealing with a nut, should
have exercise much more restraint. Indeed, given their
*stated* goals of saving the children, one might also apply
the moniker "insane" to the feds' actions.
Yup.
