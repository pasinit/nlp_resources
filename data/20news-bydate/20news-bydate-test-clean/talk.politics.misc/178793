The above conveniently ignores the murder of four BATF agents by the
Branch Davidians in an unprovoked ambush.
Say WHAT? Surrounding the compound with armed men and throwing
grenades isn't a provocation?
Any government that allows tinpot dictators to set up shop and declare
a private state has drifted into anarchy. There are laws to control
the ownership of guns and the BATF had good reason to beleive that
they were being violated. They set out to obtain a legal warrant and
attempted to serve it only to be met with gunfire when they rang
the doorbell.
You're smoking something not legal in the US. They never rang the
doorbell. Not even the BATF has claimed that they have. This was a
no-knock search.
As to the good reason the BATF has-- the warrant and supporting
affadavit have not been made public.
