If you are running Sun OpenWindows, you can use "pageview". This is an
X Window PostScript previewer like "ghostview", but displays much nicer
Yes, but it's broken on OW 2.0. It does not handle multiple pages
well. If you don't have the proper PostScript commands it will
draw the entire document on the same page instead of pausing after
each page. I haven't tried OW 3.0 yet, though.
