Yeah, you're missing the obvious fact that since the algorithm
is classified, if you reverse engineer it from the chip, and later
publish it, or build a compatible chip, you're divulging classified
information and are in a big load of trouble.
I don't think they can do that without changing the law. The chip itself
isn't classified, and reverse engineering is allowed by law (possibly)
unless prohibited by a valid contract. The algorithm may be classified,
but there are many court cases ruling that information identical to
classfied information, but obtained from unclassified sources, is freely
publishable (with the possible exception of nuclear weapon information.)
