Hi, I'm desperately seeking a (preferably shareware) program to assist in
the architectural layout of a house floorplan. Does something like this
exist other than basic CAD programs?
Please e-mail; I don't always get to the news before it expires.
Thanks in advance,
Phil Trodwell
The best I've seen is Visio. Runs under Windows. It's not shareware however.
