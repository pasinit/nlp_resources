>>>Hello,
I find this method much better myself, too, although I do really
hate it when the bolt finally comes loose and the wrench and my
hand both come crashing into my face. After coming to, which is
about 15 minutes later, I change my clothes (because by this time
all the oil has drained *on* me), and ice my entire face and suck
down about 20 Tylenol to ease the pain. Later in the day I then
proceed with refilling the engine oil.
It's just crazy how I try and change the oil on my cars in one
weekend---I go through about 3 bottles of Tylenol and 2 bags of ice.
