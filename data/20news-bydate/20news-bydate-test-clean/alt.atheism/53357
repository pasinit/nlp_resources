I read an article about a poll done of students at the Ivy League
schools in which it was reported that a third of the students
indentified themselves as atheists. This is a lot higher than among the
general population. I wonder what the reasons for this discrepancy are?
Is it because they are more intelligent? Younger? Is this the wave of
the future?
