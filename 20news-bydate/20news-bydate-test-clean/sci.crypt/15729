PGP is not available on the archive site rsa.com. If it were, it
would be highly amusing, since rsa.com (actually Public Key Partners,
but it's the same entity) is the organization holding the patents
which they claim are violated if you actually "make, use or sell" PGP.
I believe those patents also apply in Canada, but I'm not a patent
lawyer or anything.
(Sorry about double posting, but I forgot something.)
"make, use or sell" in this context have non-standard meanings:
"Make" means making an encrypted message. "Use" may mean using PGP, or
using an encrypted message. "Sell" would probably mean selling an
encrypted message. It is the message created by a "patented" process
incorporated in PGP, which infringes.
