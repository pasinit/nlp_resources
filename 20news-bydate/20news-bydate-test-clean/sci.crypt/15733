PGP is not available on the archive site rsa.com. If it were, it
would be highly amusing, since rsa.com (actually Public Key Partners,
but it's the same entity) is the organization holding the patents
which they claim are violated if you actually "make, use or sell" PGP.
I believe those patents also apply in Canada, but I'm not a patent
lawyer or anything.
The patents don't apply in Canada. I think the free trade agreement may
provide for recognition of new patents, but not old ones.
