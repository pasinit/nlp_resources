Can someone confirm this? Someone told me that Asimov converted to
Christianity at some point, or something. Does anyone have any good
quotes?
What? Absolutely not. No way. Asimov was a lifelong atheist, and
said so many times, right until his death. Judging from the many
stories he told about his own life, he felt culturally closest to
Judaism, which makes sense. He was born Jewish.
