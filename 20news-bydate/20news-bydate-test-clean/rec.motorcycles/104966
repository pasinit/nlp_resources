Ok, hold on a second and clarify something for me:
What does "DWI" stand for ? I thought it was "DUI" for Driving Under

Here in Iowa it is/has been OWI (operating under the influence) and OMVI
(operating motor vehicle under the influence). They (gov't) changed it to
OMVI so that people in motor boats could also be charged with drunk driving.
