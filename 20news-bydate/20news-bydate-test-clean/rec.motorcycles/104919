So how do I steer when my hands aren't on the bars? (Open Budweiser in left
hand, Camel cigarette in the right, no feet allowed.) If I lean, and the
bike turns, am I countersteering?
Countersteering is a method for *leaning* the bike. Another method is
leaning. Once leaned, the bike turns all by itself.
