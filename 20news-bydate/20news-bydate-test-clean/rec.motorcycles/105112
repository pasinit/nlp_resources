WHAT?!?!? On a MIKUNI??? I'm going through the exploded view of the
40mm flatslide on the 'Ol Sport, the 36mm round slide on Spike, and
the monster on my old Norton in my mind, and I can't, for the life of
me see a screw in any of them that, if it came loose could get into a
jug.
When they explode 'em, all the screws fly away.
