There's also Billy Jack, The Wild One, Smokey and the Bandit
(Where Jerry Reed runs his truck over Motorcycle Gangs Bikes),
and a video tape documentary on the Hell's Angels I
found in a rental store once
Don't forget Robert Blake in "Electra Glide in Blue" (where else do
you get to see a full-dress Harley playing with dirt bikes?).
And if you're going to count Smokey and the Bandit, then you darn
well better include "Pee-Wee's Big Adventure".
