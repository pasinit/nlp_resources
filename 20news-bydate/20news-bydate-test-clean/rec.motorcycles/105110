I'm not sure that's true. Let me rephrase; "You can file a complaint
which will bring the person into court." As I understand it, a
"citizens arrest" does not have to be the physical detention of
the person.
I think we just found the difference between a citizens arrest (physical
detention of a suspect) and a report/warrant.
Better now?
