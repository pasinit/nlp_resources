So how do I steer when my hands aren't on the bars? (Open Budweiser in left
hand, Camel cigarette in the right, no feet allowed.) If I lean, and the
bike turns, am I countersteering? Is countersteering like benchracing only
with a taller seat, so your feet aren't on the floor?

Now, while I wouldn't recommend doing this while moving,
(Maybe Mike Beaverton can complain to you awhile! :/ )
you might not want to countersteer if you're just sitting
in the driveway.
