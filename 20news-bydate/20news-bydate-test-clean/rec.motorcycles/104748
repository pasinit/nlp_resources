Careful. I was similarly impressed with it at first.
But recently I have started finding RUST spots on the
chain.
I went back to PJ1. at least the sucker never rusted
when I was using the BlueGoo(tm).
Spray the chain wax onto the rollers and sideplates occassionally, and
rust will not be a problem.
Later,
