Hi.
I've been seeing all these articles about changing
brake fluid and I am wondering if this is really necessary.
I have an 86 Toyota Corolla SR5, with 94000 and I am in the
process of doing preventative maintenance and I was
wondering if this was something that I should add to
my list of things to do.
Any information would be greatly appreciated. I really
love this car and would like to keep it for as long as
possible.
Thanx.
