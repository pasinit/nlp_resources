However, if you agree some terms, and then, when about to sign, the
dealer slips you a contract with different terms, and leads you to
believe that it embodies the terms you verbally agreed to, that
is fraud. There is no 3 day limit on restitution for fraud.
You may have to sue (and win) to get out of this. You will almost
certainly have to threaten to sue.

On the other hand, remember the old adage that a verbal agreement isn't worth
the paper it's printed on. Once you sign, you are going to have one hell of a
time proving fraud based on a comparison to what you thought you were going to
sign .
Being in the right is one thing, proving it is another.
