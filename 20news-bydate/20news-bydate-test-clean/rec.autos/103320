Examples:
Ferrari's 512TR is a flat 12 boxer.
Porsche's 911 is a flat 6.
Subaru's Impreza is a flat 4.
i think you got it the other way round: the Ferrari flat 12 is a 180
degree v12 and not a "true" boxer, while the subaru and porsche are
true boxers. don't know about the vw bug though, but i suspect that
it is also a true boxer.
