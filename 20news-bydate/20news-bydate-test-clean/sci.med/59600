I get "antsy" about posts like this. Is the concern more for son or about ex-w
ife??? The standard impartial procedure is to ask for a second opinion
about son's condition.
Then too, is son "acting out" games between divorced parents????
Precisely. One wonders what unusual strain the boy might be under that
could be causing "difficulty with his behavior". Standard practice would
be to get a second opinion from a child psychiatrist. One would want to
rule out the possibility that the "bad behavior" is not psychiatric
illness at all.
