It's plain yoghurt with grated cucumber and coriander (other spices are
sometimes used). Some people use half yoghurt and half mayonaise.
In the kind I have made I used a Lite sour cream instead of yogurt. May not
be as good for you, but I prefer the taste. A few small bits of cuke in
addition to the grated cuke may also finish the sauce off nicely.
