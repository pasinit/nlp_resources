Does anyone here know anything about chelation therapy using EDTA? My
uncle has emphesema, and a doctor wants to try it on him. We are
wondering if:
1. Is there any evidence EDTA chelation therapy is beneficial for his
condition, or any condition?
2. What possible side effects are there. How can they be mimimized?
