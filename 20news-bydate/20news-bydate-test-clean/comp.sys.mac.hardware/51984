Someone mentioned a while ago that the Duos were scheduled for a
10-18% price reduction, according to 'newsbytes'. Is this definite?
Does anyone know when it will take effect? And what is 'newsbytes'?
Local LA stores have already reduced prices by $200 on most Duo
configurations
(although Apple dropped the list price by $310).
