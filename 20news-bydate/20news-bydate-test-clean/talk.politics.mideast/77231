You appear to be referring to Moshe Dayan. How do you know that the
"evicted Jordanians" were not provided with something else? In fact,
this thread indicates that they were squatters on land that they did
not own but received compensation for their loss, anyways! Woe to
Jews when they feel that recovering land that has been taken from them
by force (with "ethnic cleansing" of any remaining Jews) is
"disgusting and shameful".
