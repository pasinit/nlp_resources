The question is how do they interpret these verses. We
must now establish reasons for not believing this to be true based on the
interpretation of these scriptures given by someone who has come to grips with

I see no other way of interpreting them other than homosexuyality
being wrong. Please tell me how these verses can be interpreted in
any other way. I read them and the surrounding text.
