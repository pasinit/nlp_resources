Isn't Origen usually cited as the most prestigious proponent of reincarnation
among Christian thinkers? What were his views, and how did he relate them
to the Christian scriptures?
He appears to have believed that. He had a view which was condemned by conciliar
action, which is often taken to be condemnation of the idea of reincarnation.
What was actually condemned was the doctrine of the pre-existence of the soul
before birth. Similar, but not exactly the same thing.
