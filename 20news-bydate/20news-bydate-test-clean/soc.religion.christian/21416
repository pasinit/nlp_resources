Basically the teaching on infallibility
holds that the pope is infallible in matters of faith and doctrine, the
college of bishops is likewise infallible, and the laity is as well.
Not exactly correct, but nice try. The Catholic doctrine of infallibility
refers to freedom from error in teaching of the universal Church in
matters of faith or MORALS. It is this teaching which is taken as
doctrine.
