It's not scriptural, but comes from the patristic age, I think:
something about "amare errantem, interficere errorem", which sounds
more like "love the errant, slay the error". No doubt someone else
will know in particular who minted the phrase. If I had to guess, I'd
blame :-) St Augustine, who seems to have had a gift for aphorism.
