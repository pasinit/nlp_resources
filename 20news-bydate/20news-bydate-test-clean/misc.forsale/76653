This posting reminded me about a long-standing question I've had.
Does it
pay to consider an underwater camera for pictures taken on land but
in
harsh environments (e.g. rain, snow, heat, cold, mud, dust)? Or are
the
lenses, etc. all "tuned" for the refractive index of water?
I have had a Nikon L35AW since 1988. Unfortunately it is no longer
made. It is a P & S sealed to resist water to a depth of 12 feet. It
is not really an underwater camera but it has been great in wet and
dusty conditions. It takes AA batteries (hooray). It has the solid,
heavy feel of old-style Nikons and has taken all the abuse I have
been able to give it. This includes a lot of water (rain, river and
sea), desert and beach sand as well as being used as a weapon
against a mugger. Shouting and swinging the camera by the strap
didn't scare the mugger away, hitting him with the flying camera
