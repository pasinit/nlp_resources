I don't think the two main free X systems ( XS3 and XFree86 ) are part
of the FSF as such.
Considering the above, and some postings about Diamond's bad attitute
towars customers, I ordered and ActixGE+ VLB 2M card. It will arive
these days.
Does anyone know of an e-mail address for Diamond to which Penio could
forward his purchase information?
