I have a system with a SCSI drive. I want to get a QIC-150 tape unit to
attach to it, and then run software that will read (and maybe even write)
UNIX TAR tapes. (Or at least just read a stream and dump it to file - I'll
take it from there).
Why is this impossible?
It isn't. ;-)
Use tar on the Un*x box and gtak110.zip on the DOS box. Needs ASPI driver.
