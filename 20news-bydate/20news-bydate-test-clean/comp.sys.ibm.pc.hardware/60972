Hello, I've been following discussions on 17" monitors in
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware and noted that the Nanao seems to get very good
reviews. I'm interested in getting more information about Nanao's products
. How can I get ahold of Nanao?
Nanao: call 1-800-800-5202. Ask for a catalog.
What's list and street cost - if avail. from a third party.
