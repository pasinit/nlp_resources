You can find the drivers at wuarchive.wustl.edu in the /msdos/windows3 sub-
directory. I think the files are called "tvgawin31a.zip" and "tvgawin31b.zip."
Those are the latest drivers available as far as I know.
I downloaded these files a couple of days ago and they appeared to be
incompatible with this particular card. None of the SVGA drivers worked.
They're probably for the newer 8900 and 9000 series.
