Hi All,
This is the first time I've posted to the net, so I hope this is
going to the right people.
I'm looking for software packages that run on an IBM PC clone that
allows me to display Openlook and motif windows on the PC.
I highly recommend Starnet's Micro-X. They have versions for DOS and Windows,
with support for PC/TCP, or the Clarkson packet drivers. I have used it
successfully with twm, mwm, and olwm, over both ethernet and SLIP.
And their tech support is top notch. They really impressed me.
Kevin
