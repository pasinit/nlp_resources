Is there a tn3270 program which support xterm? I don't like x3270 at all. You
can't copy with other windows. Thanks.
The x3270 at export.lcs.mit.edu supposedly does. I use another x3270
that was cleaned up by Brian Ward <> which adds better
color support, and cleans up _lots_ of bugs, as well as cut&paste.
I just put it on export.lcs.mit.edu, as x3270v2.65beta.tar.Z.
