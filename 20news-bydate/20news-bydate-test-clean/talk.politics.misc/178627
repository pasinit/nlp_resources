One could easily point out that the jury decided that this "extremely
difficult call" could be made, which is why the two of the defendants
were found guilty. One could also make some interesting observations on
our system of justice, where the men were not guilty of excessive force,
but guilty enough to have violated his civil rights by use of the
(non-existant) excessive force.

It is also interesting to note that Powell (and maybe Koons) were found
guilty of aiding and abetting the deprival of King's civil rights.but,
two others who also beat King and all the others who watched were not.
Go figure? Can you say sacraficial lambs? Can you say appeal?
