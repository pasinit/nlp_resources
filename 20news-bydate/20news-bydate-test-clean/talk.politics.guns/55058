For the moment, forget about BATF incompetence or FBI hubris. Did
anybody catch Rep. Charles Shumer on the news last night holding up
a .50 BMG cartridge and rhetorically asking if anybody should be allowed
to own one of these. (I presume he meant the rifle for which it is chambered
and not the cartridge which you can get for a buck.)
So what's your guess for the upcoming anti-gun agenda:
1. A ban on heavy caliber rifles. (read .50 BMG)
2. A ban on "sniper rifles"
3. A ban on "stockpiling" guns and ammunition.
BTW: Shumer is perhaps the most misinformed congressman I have seen on
the news. I wonder how he finds the floor in the morning.

Shumer is not mis-informed, he knows full well what he is doing.
