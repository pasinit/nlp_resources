Hey Larry,
How can you be a comp sci major and never crash a damn computer.
What does your CS dept teach you.or are you just that good of a programmer
that not one of your assembly programs have ever downed your machine.
"Crash Protection" is such
a marketing gimick, it isn't funny. Out of 4 months of using Windows on my
new machine I've only had it crash ONCE, and I don't have a "run of the mill"
configuration.
