Hi,
I've been using Plannet Crafter's "Plug-in" for Program Manager.
The best one I've seen is CEO, by Sloop Software. They have a
sharware version, but the retail version is only $40-50. It's
incredibly complete, subfolders to any level, choose any icon,
hot keys, drop down menus, button bars, etc. Haven't found
anything it doesn't do. Try mailing
for details.
