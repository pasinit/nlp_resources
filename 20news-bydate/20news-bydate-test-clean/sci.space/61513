How hard or easy would it be to have a combo mission such as a solar sail on
the way out to the outer planets, but once in near to orbit to use more normal
means.
Seems that everyone talks about using one system and one system only per
mission, why not have more than one propulsion system? Or did I miss
something. ?? or did it die in committee?
