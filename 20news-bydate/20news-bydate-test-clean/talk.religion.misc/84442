The OED gives the etymology of "sibyl" as coming from the ancient Greek
sigma iota beta upsilon lambda lambda alpha
( S i b ih l l a )
which is claimed to come from the Doric
sigma iota omicron beta upsilon lambda lambda alpha
( s i o b ih l l a )
which (if I read it properly) in turn came from the Attican (Athenian)
theta epsilon omicron beta omicron upsilon lambda eta
( th eh o b o ih l ae )
I don't know much about Attis, but it wouldn't surprise me to learn that
this God was tied to the Athenian capital
Alpha tau tau iota kappa upsilon sigma
