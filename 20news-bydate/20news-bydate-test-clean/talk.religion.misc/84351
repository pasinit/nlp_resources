Oh, lawdy. If that experience didn't teach you that your
perceptions are always going to get between you & "reality",
It sure did!
I don't know what will. Have you read anything about how
your brain works? About various sensory illusions you can
be tricked by?
I have; and all the above teach me that accurately perceiving reality
is a tricky business -- _not_ that there's no reality.
