You sound absolutely convinced! Tell me how long did it last, what color
was it?
Since you asked. from the Big Bang to the formation of atoms is about
10E11 seconds. As for the "color": bright. Very very bright.
It must be so exciting to know for sure.
I don't. I believe the current theory of cosmology because it is fairly
well supported by observational evidence (not as well supported as, say
evolution or relativity, but that's another matter). You're the one who
proposes unquestioningly accepting religious dogma as fact (apologies if
you're not actually a creationist).
By the way, it seems as
though there is a fine line between "postulating new miracles" and postulating
new theories.
The line is broader than you think. Theories are supported by evidence.
Miracles are supported by someone's say-so.
