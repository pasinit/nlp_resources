Who ever said he was? What is obvious is that he was defending himself, and his
followers, from the government. Whether you think he was right or wrong in
this is another question. If he was right, then he had the moral right to kill
those kgBATF agents.

The killing of the ATF agents is a separate issue. My point is that many
children died because of Koresh defending himself. Did he have what you
call the "moral right" to keep those children in a dangerous enviroment in
order to defend himself?
