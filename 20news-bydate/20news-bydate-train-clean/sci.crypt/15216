PROCUREMENT AND USE OF ENCRYPTION DEVICES
[ . ]
The Attorney General will procure and utilize encryption devices to
the extent needed to preserve the government's ability to conduct
lawful electronic surveillance and to fulfill the need for secure
law enforcement communications. Further, the Attorney General
shall utilize funds from the Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture
Super Surplus Fund to effect this purchase.
Talk about adding insult to injury .
I, for one, believe that the use of civil forfeiture should be abolished by
a decent administration, not continued. Instead, it looks like that
ill-gotten gain will be used to help pay for wiretap equipment.
