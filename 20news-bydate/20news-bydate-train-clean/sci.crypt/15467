A few more sources are statistics on your filesystems (easily
and quickly obtained) and the output from the "rusage" system
call.
You can also exec a finger to one or more favorite heavily-used
systems, though this can take several seconds.
cf. the source code to RIPEM on ripem.msu.edu.

Other alternatives include output of vmstat, iostat, pstat and friends
with various flags, or even better crash.
e.g. on an RS/6000 (AIX 3.2) you can get lots of relatively
unpredicatble data out of crash. (the output from the following script
usually gives about 600k of goo on a moderately busy system.)
