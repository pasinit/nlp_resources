Quoting in article <>:
You have every reason to be scared shitless. Take a look at the records
of McCarthy, Hoover (J. Edgar, not the cleaner - though they both excelled at
sucking) and Nixon.
History does not record whether J. Edgar Hoover was any good at sucking.
As for the cleaners, I'll stick with my 850W Electrolux and damn the
carpet.
