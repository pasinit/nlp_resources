In a previous article, (Christopher D. Colvin) says:
I worked at AMORC when I was in HS.
OK: So you were a naive teen.
He [HS Lewis] dates back to the 20's.
Wrong: 1915 and if you do your homework, 1909.
But he was born LAST century (1883).
Right now AMORC is embroiled in some internal political turmoil.
