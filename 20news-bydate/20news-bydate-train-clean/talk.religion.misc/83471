Firstly, science has its basis in values, not the other way round.
You keep saying that. I do not think it means what you think it
means.
Perhaps you should explain what you think "science has it's basis
in values" means. The reason why people DO science is that
they value it's results. That does not mean that science has
it's basis in values. Any more than DES stops working if I stop
valuing my privacy.
So you better explain what objective atoms are, and how we get them
from subjective values, before we go any further.
See above.
