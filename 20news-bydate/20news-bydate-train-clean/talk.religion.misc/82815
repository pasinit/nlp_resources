Concerniong this thread.
Has anyone ever seen "Drop Dead Fred" ?? THis movie seems to tipify the
"imaginary friend" theme rather well. I LOVED the movie, as i had an
imaginary friend when i was a kid and it borught back great memories.
Seriously, if you have a chance, see "Drop Dead Fred". It'll make ya
think. especially the end.
Blessings!
