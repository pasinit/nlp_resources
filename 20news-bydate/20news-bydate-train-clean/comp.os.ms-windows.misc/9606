Has anyone used the Number Nine (# 9) Video Graphics adaptor with Windows
or Windows NT? What do you think???
I just put one in my machine last week. I have an AST 486/66. I was
getting ~10million winmarks with my Diamond SS24, and the #9 board is
doing ~20million winmarks. From my brief experiences with it, i'm very
satisfied. BTW, this is with Win 3.1.
