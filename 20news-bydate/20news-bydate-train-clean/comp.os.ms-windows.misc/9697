Take a look at ftp.cica.indiana.edu at pub/pc/win3/(util?misc?)
for a program caleld vswitch.zip.It's as close to want you want as you can
get in WIn3.1 .
I think George is referring to switch.zip in the ~ftp/pub/pc/win3/drivers/video
directory. Description reads -- Switcher: Windows Video Mode Switcher.
