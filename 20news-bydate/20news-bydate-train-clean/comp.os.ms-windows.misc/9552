Anybody seen mouse cursor distortion running the Diamond 1024x768x256 driver?
Sorry, don't know the version of the driver (no indication in the menus) but it's a recently
delivered Gateway system. Am going to try the latest drivers from Diamond BBS but wondered
if anyone else had seen this.
Sporadically, yes. It seems to flicker, or change shape into snow
briefly. Not enough to impair functionality, just call attention to
Diamond's professional sloppiness.
