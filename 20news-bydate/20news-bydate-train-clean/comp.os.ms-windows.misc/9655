Hi there,
Is there any utility available that will make Windows
randomly select one of your windows directory's .BMP
files as the wallpaper file?

There are a couple. I am personally using screenpeace, which is a
screen saver which will also select your wallpaper from a specified
directory (not necessarily the windows dir.). Let me know if you want
info. I've been pretty happy with screenpeace, and the latest version
(3) is *not* at cica, but oak, /windows3/scrpc3or.something
