What the status of Trumpet for Windows? Will it use the Windows sockets ?
I liked it in DOS but had to abandon it since I started using NDIS to access
our token ring (results in invalid class error :(
While I do not speak for Peter Tattam, I am fairly sure he is planning a
Winsock compliant version. While this will definitely not make the initial
public release of WinTrumpet, it will follow on shortly thereafter.
Currently WinTrumpet is in very late beta. It looks like an excellent
product, with several features beyond the DOS version.
WinTrumpet supports the Trumpet TCP, Novell LWP, and there is also a direct to
packet driver version that some people are using with the dis_pkt shim.
