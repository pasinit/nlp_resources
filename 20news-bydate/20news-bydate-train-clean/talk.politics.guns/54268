A BILL
To establish the right to obtain firearms for security, and
to use firearms in defense of self, family, or home, and
to provide for the enforcement of such right.
Maybe I'm too "religious," but when I see a bill to "establish a right,"
I wince. Keep in mind, what the law giveth, the law can taketh away.
