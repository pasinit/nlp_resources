Your posting provoked me into checking my save file for memorable
posts. The first I captured was by Ken Arromdee on 19 Feb 1990, on the
subject "Re: atheist too?". That was article #473 here; your question
was article #53766, which is an average of about 48 articles a day for
the last three years. As others have noted, the current posting rate is
such that my kill file is depressing large. Among the posting I
saved in the early days were articles from the following notables:
From: (Loren Petrich)
From: (Jesus Christ of Nazareth)
From: (Mark Crispin)
From: (Jim Perry)
From: (James J. Lippard)
From: (Marvin Minsky)
An interesting bunch. I wonder where #2 is?
