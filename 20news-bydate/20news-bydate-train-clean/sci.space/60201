Ooooh -- who would have thought that Galileo would get the chance to
check out a comet TOO?!?
Comet Gehrels 3, which was discovered in 1977, was determined to have
been in a temporary Jovian orbit from 1970 to 1973. Comet Shoemaker-Levy 1993e
may remain in orbit around Jupiter long enough to allow Galileo to
make some closeup observations. The orbital trajectory for Comet
Shoemaker-Levy is still being determined.
