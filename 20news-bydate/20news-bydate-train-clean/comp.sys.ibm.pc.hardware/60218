my home Viewsonic 6. I like the Multisyncs because it's easy to run them
in modes like 800x600x64k colors noninterlaced, or at higher modes like
1360x1024x16.
Oh yeah! I just got my new Eizo Flexscan yesterday (to replace my old 8515), and
I tried it with 1360x1024. This mode is just great! I can get four perfectly readable
command windows on the screen! And if I need more colors, I can go back to 1024x768
or even 800x600.
