Hi,
I am buying a Quantum LPS240AT 245 MB hardisk and is deciding a
HDD/FDD controller. Is 32-bit VL-bus HDD/FDD controller faster
than 16 bit IDE HDD/FDD controller card?
No, VL-bus IDE is no faster than ISA IDE. The IDE interface is
fundamentally nothing more than an extension of the ISA bus, and if
you hook it to VL-bus it'll work as fast as the slower of the two,
meaning ISA speed.
I hear that
the VL bus controller is SLOWER than a IDE controller?
