Excerpts from netnews.comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware: 19-Apr-93 AMD i486
clones: Now legal . by
A friend of mine called me on the phone and told me he was wathcing CNN
and saw a report that the ruling prohibiting AMD from selling their i486
clones has been thrown out, making it legal for AMD to ship in the US.
Can anyone out there verify this?
It's true. I read about it from an article in ClariNet (can't send it
here though). U.S. District Court Judge William A. Ingram, of San
Francisco, threw out the jury verdict prohibiting AMD from using Intels'
microcode for the 486.
