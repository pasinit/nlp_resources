What's the difference between the F550i and the new F550iW? I'm
about to buy a Gateway system and was going to take the F550i
upgrade. Should I get the F550iW instead?

The F550iW is optimized for Windows. It powers down when the screen
blanker appears, it powers down with you turn your computer off, and it
meets all of the Swedish standards. It's also protected against EMI from
adjacent monitors.
