My fiance has a pc-junior and wants to upgrade to a full 386. Does anyone
know if we could use the monitor it came with on a new machine? I heard
it's MCGA or EGA, but not sure which. Also, does it use cards, so we can
use the drive controller, floppy, etc?
The only things you'll be able to salvage from the junior are the floppy drives
and monitor. The floppies are 360k, and the monitor is CGA, but you will need
an adaptor cable to use it. The junior does not use standard cards. Unless
you're really strapped for cash, you should just junk the thing and buy new
stuff.
