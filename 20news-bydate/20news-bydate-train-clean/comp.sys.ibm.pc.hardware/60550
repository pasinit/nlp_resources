Is there a more recent version of umbdr522.zip because it doesn't
work on my machine.
My motherboard has Symphony SL82C362 chips and they say it will be
supported in the later versions, so is it out ?
Thank you for helping.

The last I heard, the author was having some problems in his immediate
family and had delayed the continuation of development for a time.
This was some months ago.
It's a shame. The driver is the best memory manager I have found
ANYWHERE. It doesn't require V8086 mode (like QEMM) so it works with
Ultima 7. It doesn't take ANY memory (runs, then exits).
If only the EMM provider were a little faster and more stable.
