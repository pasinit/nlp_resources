Computer: 286-25 mhz
Bus: ISA (12.5 mhz)
Drive: Maxtor 7213A (213 mb)
I'd still like to here from people with VLB-IDE.
I still want to know what VLB bus speed is used with IDE drives.
I still want to know if some (most ?) IDE drives can handle bus speeds > 8 mhz.
I recently bought a Micron 486DX/33 VLB computer and the the local bus
ide card was getting around 1k/s transfer rates (says norton). I caled
micron because this seemed pathetically slow and they said that norton
6.xx doesn't recognize local bus and won't give accurate results. I was
told I would need norton 7.0 in order to get a true account of my ide
transfer speed.
I didn't really like this answer in part because the drive doesn't seem
as though it's cranking along at much more than that, but I also don't
know if I could tell the difference.
I tried playing around with settings in the CMOS (bus speed at the like)
and noticed no significant change in performance.
