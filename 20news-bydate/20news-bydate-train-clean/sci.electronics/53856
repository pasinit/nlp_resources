I was wondering, what copy protection techniques are avaliable, and how
effective are they? Has anyone have any experience in this area?
With highest regards,

One of the easiest, and really very used ways of copyprotection, is to mark
a specific sector on the installation disk bad. This is very easy to get
around, though, if you have any knowledge of hw-hacking, but most 'normal'
users (yes those lowly key-punchers) don't. Whatever you do, please do
_not_ use a hardware key. These were very popular a few years ago, and they
STINK!!
