Murphy's Law: If anything can go wrong, it will.
We are all quite familiar with the amplifications and commentary on
Murphy's Law. But how do we harmonize that with Romans 8:28? For that

I've always taken Murphy's Law to be an exhortation to prudence, and
an observation about the behavior of complex systems, rather than a
denial of divine benevolence.
