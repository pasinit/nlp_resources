Which Version of the Bible do you consider to be the most
accurate translation?
Well, knowing Greek and Hebrew, I'm probably not as picky about translations
as I would be if English translations were my only source of information.
BUT.
(1) Any verse that comes out substantially different in different trans-
lations is almost certainly unclear in the original.
(2) It is very bad practice to "shop" for a translation that fits your own
doctrinal positions.
Personally, I still like the RSV. NRSV and NASV are also very good.
I have a strong preference for editions that do _not_ indent the beginning
of each verse as if verses were paragraphs. The verse numbering is a
relatively modern addition and should not be given undue prominence.
