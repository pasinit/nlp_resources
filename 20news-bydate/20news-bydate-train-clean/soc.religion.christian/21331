Here's a question that some friends and I were debating last night.
Q: If you knew beyond all doubt that hell did not exist and that
unbelievers simply remained dead, would you remain a Christian?
My contention is that if you answer this question with "No. I would
not then remain a Christian" then you really are not one now.
Following Jesus Christ has everything to do with sharing in
his work and spreading the news that the Kingdom of Heaven is already
among us. Fear-based religion is not a faith-relationship with the
One Who made us all.
So does that mean that anyone who is a Christian to avoid Hell isn't really
a Christian at all? It sounds like it to me.
