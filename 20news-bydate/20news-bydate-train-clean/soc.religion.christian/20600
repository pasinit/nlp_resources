The real problem was
that Christians were pacifist and preached there was only one god. When the
state operates by a system of divinitation of the emperor - monotheism

I disagree with your claim that Jews were not evangelistic (except in
the narrow sense of the word). Jewish proselytism was widespread.
There are numerous accounts of Jewish proselytism, both in the New
Testament and in Roman and Greek documents of the day.
