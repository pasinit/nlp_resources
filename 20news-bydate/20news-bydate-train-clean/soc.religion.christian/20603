In article <>, (Cardinal Ximenez) writes:
I don't think it's possible to convince atheists of the validity of
Christianity through argument. We have to help foster faith and an
understanding of God. I could be wrong--are there any former atheists here
who were led to Christianity by argument?
This is an excellent question and I'll be anxious to see if there are
any such cases. I doubt it. In the medieval period (esp. 10th-cent.
when Aquinas flourished) argument was a useful tool because everyone
"knew the rules." Today, when you can't count on people knowing even
the basics of logic or seeing through rhetoric, a good argument is
often indistinguishable from a poor one.
Sorry; just one of my perennial gripes.<:->
