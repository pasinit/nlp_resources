Actually, this doesn't always work for me either. I have wind that
blows around inside my RF200 some, and it'll dry my eyes out / get dust
in them eventually unless I'm also wearing sunglasses inside my
helmet.
I too, usually wear sunglasses inside my full face helmet to keep dirt & wind
out of my contacts. Mumble, mumble, mumble .
