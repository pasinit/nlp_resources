Folks,
I am assembling info for a Film Criticism class final project.
Essentially I need any/all movies that use motos in any substantial
capacity (IE; Fallen Angles, T2, H-D & the Marlboro Man,
Raising Arizona, etc).
Any help you fellow r.m'ers could give me would be much `preciated.
(BTW, a summary of bike(s) or plot is helpful but not necessary)
Easy Rider (harleys, drugs, rednecks, New Orleans), Mad Max (violence, DoD
wanna-be's), Time Rider (Honda Thumper, Time travel), On Any Sunday
(Documentary about dirtbike racers, GREAT!), The (Great?) Escape (Steve
Mcqueen, Nazis), Rebel Without a Cause (James Dean, future DoD'ers). I
think the last two are right, they are OLD movies I haven't seen in YEARS.
