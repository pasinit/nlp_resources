In a previous article, (daniel warren c) says:
Yo, did anybody see this run of HARD COPY?
No, I don't watch that Bu**Sh*t.
The Kat, although not the latest machine, is still a high performance
machine and he slams on the brakes. Of couse, we all know that cages,
especially the ones with the disco lights, can't stop as fast as our
high performance machines. So what happens?. The cage plows into the
Kat.
So, does this mean the cop is at fault for rear-ending the bike? You know,
following too closely and reckless driving?
