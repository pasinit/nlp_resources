On the other side of the fence, I owned a Bieffe off-road helmet.
Took what I would consider a minor fall, and had visible damage
to the shell. Yes, the helmet did its job. But the damage/impact
ratio was scary. I own Bell Moto-5 now, have taken impacts on
order of twice the Bieffe impact (we do this frequently in MX),
