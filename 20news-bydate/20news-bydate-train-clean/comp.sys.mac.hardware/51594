addressing modes. commands that do fills should be slightly faster
since the new instructions fetch 2 bytes at a time versus one.
Even the 68000 can fetch two bytes at a time.
The new instruction in the 68040 is MOVE16 which fetches 16 bytes
at a time instead of 4 which the 68030 has; that means 4 24bit
pixels instead of one.
