As the author of "DPI on the Fry" I can tell you that there is no way
for a
graphics card to know what resolution its connected monitor will actually
support. That's why we have these silly cables. The cable just
identifies
that monitor as supporting a given resolution.
Therefore the software will support any multisync monitor. I've heard
that
radius has a similar program for the quadra.
Is this software available either commercially or public domain? If so
