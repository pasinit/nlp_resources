The audio will simply select the CD audio when the microphone is removed.
I don't believe the button un-dims, since there's nothing to select. I
haven't tracked down a Centris to check this on though.
Sorry, I assumed that the the various new machines with the internal
CD-ROM bay worked the same as the Quadra 900. Obviously they don't.
Yup, I made the same mistake several months ago when this issue came up
before :-)
noah
