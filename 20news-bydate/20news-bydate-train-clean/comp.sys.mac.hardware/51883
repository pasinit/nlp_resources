Question for those familiar with Quadra VRAM:
I put 2 256K VRAM SIMMs in my Quadra 700 (in the 2 slots closest to the
RAM SIMM slots) and I got no results whatsoever. I have been told that
the built-in video should support at least 16bit and maybe 24bit color on
a Macintosh Color Display. However, the Monitors control panel still
lists 8bit (256 colors) as the highest possible.
Does it make any difference which slots you put the SIMMs in?
Do you have to do something to activate them?
Do you have to do something to the Monitors control panel?
BTW, I am running System 7.1 with 8 Megs of RAM.
