>I believe it is illegal for a residency to discriminate against FMGs.
Is that true? I know some that won't even interview FMGs.
I think a case could be made that this is discriminatory, particularly
if an applicant had good board scores and recommendations but wasn't
offered an interview, but I don't know if it has ever gone to court.
