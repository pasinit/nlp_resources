My 6 year son is so plagued. Lots of vaseline up his nose each night seems
to keep it under control. But let him get bopped there, and he'll recur for
days! Also allergies, colds, dry air all seem to contribute. But again, the
vaseline, or A&D ointment, or neosporin all seem to keep them from recurring.
If you can get it, you might want to try a Canadian over-the-counter product
called Secaris, which is a water-soluble gel. Compared to Vaseline or other
greasy ointments, Secaris seems more compatible with the moisture that's
already there.
