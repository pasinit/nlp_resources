In a previous article, (Brent "Woody" Moss) says:
I was worried about someone stealing my oil once also. I finally
decided to just have my drain plug welded shut. It works great !
I figure that when I add three or four quarts when the oil light
comes on every month or so that it's just as good or better than
the old wives tale of changing the oil AND filter every 3000 miles.
Works for me, I must say.
I did the same thing to my drain plug for the same reasons. I was wondering
how you filled your crankcase though as I welded my hood shut also out of fear
that somebody might steal my air-filter.
