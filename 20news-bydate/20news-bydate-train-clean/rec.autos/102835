If you hold off, there are a number of interesting convertibles coming
to market in the next few years.
The new LeBaron will be based on the Mitsubishi Galant, which should
be an improvement over the current model.
The new PL compact will have a convertible option (also a chrysler
product)
Kia, makers of the Ford Festiva is planning a larger convertible.
