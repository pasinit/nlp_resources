It seems like XTranslateCoord. doesn't work the way I expecting it. Right
after performs a XMoveWindow, I want to know the absolute window position
with respect to the root window. To get this info. I do a XTranslateCoordinates
but the abs_x, and abs_y aren't right? Does anybody know of a way to find
out this information?
Thanks, please e-mail to if it's possible
