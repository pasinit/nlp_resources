HI,
I am looking for an X app that will display dxf files. These are
ascii text files that are normally associated with autocad. I have
a large 9 meg. file of the state of wisconsin that i would like to
views and or cut into smaller chunks.
I also would like to find a complete file layout for dxf files.
Any information would be appreciated.
