The other scary thing is that I ship libxcl.so with the 6 functions
in it; how many other libxcl.so type libraries will be shipped by
other vendors? Should I trademark the name libxcl.a? What if
some clown uses that name and only puts 4 of the troublesome
functions in it?
Does USL SVR4 support LD_RUN_PATH a la Solaris 2?
Or an equivalent?
If so, you can put the library in a package specific lib directory,
compile the app with LD_RUN_PATH defined, and all should work.
Besides, I'd say name it libPACKAGExcl.a if possible.
Cheers,
