HI,
I was just wondering if anyone knew when Erickson
and Keith Miller are expected to come back and what
exactly ails them.
Dunno about Miller.
If you mean Scott Erickson, currently the reigning Twins Least Consistent
Good Player, he pulled a muscle in the neighborhood of the rib cage that
made it essentially impossible for him to pitch temporarily, and is
expected back on the mound Sunday.
