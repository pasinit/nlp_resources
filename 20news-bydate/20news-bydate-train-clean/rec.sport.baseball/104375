Actually, for the Padres this year so far it's 23%. They are 5th in
the league in HRs, and ALL have been solo shots.
Pythagorean projection puts them at .360 winning percentage
or 58-104. Need some pitching help, fast!
Good news, though, is that Hurst has been throwing curveballs
w/o any pain. Threw 80 pitches yesterday. Should be back
in a couple of weeks. Maybe we can trade him to the Yankees
for Militello.
