I fail to see why you should feel this way in the first place. Constant
combat isn't particularly conducive to intellectual theorizing. Also,
they tend to get invaded before they can come to anything like a stable
society anyway.
And the reason that the Soviet Union couldn't achieve the ideal of pure
communism was the hostility of surrounding capitalist nations.Uh huh.
Somehow, this all sounds familiar. Once again, utopian dreams are
confronted by the real world.
