In case you haven't noticed, Clintonites are pushing a universal health
care ACCESS program. "Access" here means that folks who do not give
a damn about immunizing their children will have health care services
delivered to their doorsteps.
I've read about more than a few of these programs that ran into
problems in convincing parents to get their children immunized even
when they were delivered to their doorstep. (I don't know, maybe
that sheet they have to be informed of about possible risks, side-
effects, and bad reactions scares them.)
