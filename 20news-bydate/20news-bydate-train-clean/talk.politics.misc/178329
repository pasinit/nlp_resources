It is the government that is preventing entry to the market. The
desire of those running established businesses to prevent or
restrict the entry of competitors is an understandable, though
generally unpleasant, human failing. But without a means to act
on this desire, without a government with sufficient power to
restrict the options of the potential competitor, the
anti-competitive desire remains just an unpleasant wish. The
government is the linchpin, so we seek to disengage it so we
don't get the shaft.
Once again, Mark, you don't specify the means through which the government
is to be prevented from becoming the tool of business interests. As a
left-wing, big government, conventional liberal, I'm just as willing as
you are to vote against anti-competitive regulations that favor auto
dealers.
But what I hear from libertarians is a desire to limit incumbents' terms,
to weaken government by eliminating its power to enforce antitrust laws,
and a desire to eliminate legislator's pay. Each strikes me as a
particularly ineffective way to insure that auto dealers and other special
interests cannot influence public policy. In fact, they seem clearly
designed to accomplish the opposite.
