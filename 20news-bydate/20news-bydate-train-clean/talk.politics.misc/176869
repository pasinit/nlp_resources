Personally, I doubt she said anything of the kind, but if
someone can provide the ORIGINAL quote, IN CONTEXT, WITH SOURCE
(for, ahem, cross-checking), I would we willing to agree
she is full of sh*t. Naturally, if no one can provide these
bits of data, the paraphrase listed must be disregarded,
and its poster regarded as full of sh*t. OK, so which will it be?
I followed up without a thought of double-checking.if I double-checked
every fact people vomited onto the table here on the net, I'd never have
time to sleep. But to pass the buck to the person who originally posted
that quote.
.well, Michael? Take it away! (wild applause)
