What I see is that the media is reasonably fair, but is seen as
'liberal' by conservatives, and 'conservative' by liberals.
Not that I think anyone cares, but this pattern (using other examples
of course) was discussed 2,000 years ago by Aristotle in
_Nicomachean_Ethics_. Note that you can't use this insight to reason
backwards; e.g.: Since the conservatives see the media as liberal and
the liberals see the media as conservative, the media are fair! (though
I've seen this "reasoning" implied)
