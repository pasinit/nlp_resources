I sometimes see OTC preparations for muscle aches/back aches that
combine aspirin with a diuretic.
You certainly do not see OTC preparations advertised as such.
The only such ridiculous concoctions are nostrums for premenstrual
syndrome, ostensibly to treat headache and "bloating" simultaneously.
They're worthless.
The idea seems to be to reduce
inflammation by getting rid of fluid. Does this actually work?
That's not the idea, and no, they don't work.
