On the other hand, we do a good job of implying that the person who
weighs 400lbs is "overeating" when in fact, the body probably doesn't
make any moral judgements about its composition. Conceivably, the
body works just as hard maintaining its weight at 400 as someone else's
does at 200.
Undoubtedly it does, to maintain such a weight. And it does so
primarily by overeating. If it didn't, the weight would drop
back to normal.
