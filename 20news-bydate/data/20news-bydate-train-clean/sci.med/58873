OK, so how do you define healthy people?
My wife cannot donate blood because she has been to a malarial region
in the past three years. In fact, she tried to have her bone marrow
typed and they wouldn't even do that! Why?
I can't donate blood either because not only have I been to a malarial
region, but I have also been diagnosed (and surgically treated) for
testicular cancer. The blood bank wont accept blood from me for 10
years.
Obviously, it wouldn't be of much help to treat one problem by knowingly
introducing another. Cancer mestastizes. My imperfect understanding of
the facts are that gonadal cancer is particularly dangerous in this regard.
I haven't done the research on it, but I don't recall ever hearing of a
case of cancer being transmitted by a blood transfusion. Probably just a
common sense kind of arbitrary precaution. Transmissable diseases like
malaria though are obviously another story.
