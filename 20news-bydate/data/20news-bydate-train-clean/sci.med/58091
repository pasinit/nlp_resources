How long does it take a smoker's lungs to clear of the tar after quitting?
Does your chances of getting lung cancer decrease quickly or does it take
a considerable amount of time for that to happen?
Seems to me that I read in either a recent NY Times
Science Times or maybe it was Science News that there is
evidence that ex-smoker's risk of lung cancer never returns
to that of a person who has never smoked (I think it may
get close). I'll find the article and post it since my
memory is hazy on the specifics - if you are interested.
