Besides, for 0 wait state performance, you'd need a cache anyway. I mean,
who uses a processor that runs at the speed of 80ns SIMMs? Note that this
memory speed corresponds to a clock speed of 12.5 MHz.

How do you calculate that figure? I'd assume even in personal computers
the board designers would use bank switching to (optimistically)
quadruple the access speed or am I missing something here?
