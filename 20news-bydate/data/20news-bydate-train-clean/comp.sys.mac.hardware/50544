I'm interested in getting a 14" color monitor for my new LCIII.
Unfortunately, I'm really quite confused with the Sony monitors.
Could someone please compare the Sony 1320, 1304 and the Apple 14"?
Thanks. Dan
Just thought I would mention that Sony no longer manufactures the CPD-
1304 because of several manufacturing flaws. The new model is now the
1430, which just like Apple's new Sony Trinitrom CLAIMS to be 14 inches.
I'm not sure of the details on the defects, but I work at our schools
