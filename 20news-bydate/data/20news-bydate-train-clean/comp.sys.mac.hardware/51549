I also believe that the 950 fixed a bug in the CPU which screwed up
some floating point calculations.
Does anyone have details on this? What sort of FP errors is
the Q900 sensitive to?
(My Q900 is having some strange problems with an FP intensive
program, getting a lot of DS15 (Segment Loader) errors. ThinkC5.0.4 and
System 7.0.1+)
