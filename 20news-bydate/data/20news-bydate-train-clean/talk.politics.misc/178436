I'm curious why you took a beign statement and cross-posted it to several
different news groups, including something along the lines of
alt.discrimination.
Exsqueeze me? I saw *your* original post in alt.discrimination.
Your post was cross-posted to three groups. My followup was cross-posted
to two of those three (omitting soc.motss).
Now, instead of engaging in meta-discussion off the topic, could you answer
the question posed? If your statement is so "beign"(!?), you should have no
trouble politely responding to a polite query.
