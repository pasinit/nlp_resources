Garrett, you are a really pathetic liar.
Isn't name calling fun!
Some of your charges are arguable, but most of them are obvious lies.
I challenge you to present us with any evidence that Nixon stole,
rigged a national election, never mind elections, or used the powers
of his office for personal gain.
What do you think happened at Watergate? What do you think they broke into
the building for? It wasn't to just look around. Do I have to draw you
a picture?
You can't because there is absolutely no evidence that any of these
events occurred.
Whatever.
