In a previous article, (Guy Dawson) says:
Something to bear in mind is what the V in VLB stands for!
V for Video - the origional intention of the bus was to speed up
the bus so that large memory to memory transfers would be faster.
This is espically useful in transfering data from main memory to
video memory.
Well, not to be picky, but the V in VLB stands for VESA.
