Is the 486DX3/99 anything more than a myth? I haven't heard of it
from any source that I trust, and I sure don't see any ads for DX3/99
machines in Computer Shopper. Intel is pretty busy with the Pentium
right now; I can't seem them introducing their own competition.
IBM has displayed a 486DX3/99 as a *TECHNOLOGY DEMO*.
This effectivly means - "here's some neat technology". It is not
a commitment to make such an item.
