Has anybody bought a Pentium motherboard? If so or you where I can
buy it, please send me a E-mail. Thank you in advance.
Pentium processors / motherboards are not available to the general public as
of yet. Intel has released them to companies such as Gateway and Dell
to do testing, etc. It'll be a while.
