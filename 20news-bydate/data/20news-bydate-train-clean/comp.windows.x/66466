Hi,
I just compiled the X11R5 distribution for a Sun3/SunOS4.1.1. I also
compiled the public domain xview3 (with olwm) distribution. I have some
old 3rd-party application binaries that are SunView programs. How do I
get them to work under xview3 and olwm? (I tried using the OpenWindows
version 2 "svenv" program, but it did not work.)
I do not have news access.that's why I am mailing this directly. Also,
is there an email alias where my questions can get to comp.windows.x or
comp.windows.open-look? PLEASE RESPOND TO
Thanks,
Shash
