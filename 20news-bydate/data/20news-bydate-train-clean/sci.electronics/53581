Since an on-hook line is aprox 48-50V, and off-hook it usually drops below 10V.
How about an LED in series with a zener say around 30V.
On-hook = LED on
Off-hook = LED off.
Would this work? If anyone tries/tried it, please let me know.
Not recommended. Your circuit would take too much current, when
telephone is on-hook. Telephone company does not like it.
