This cooling off period applies only in certain situations - lik ewhen
you are solicited at home. I also think the cooling off period ends
if you actually accept the merchandise.
If this were not the case, any car buyer would have the right to return
a slightly used, highly devalued, car 2 days after buying it. Yeah -
that's the trick - if I want to buy a new car, I'd have a firend buy
& return one, then go in and negotiate a better deal on a pre-owned
used car.
FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY
On the other hand, if it can be proven, it's possible the changed
terms could be thrown out. The question will be whether the
agreement contains a merger clause. See UCC @ 2-202 (parol
evidence). If we're talking about warranties, then, of course,
UCC @ 2-316 should be looked at.
But we have so little information that none of us can say anything
conclusive.
