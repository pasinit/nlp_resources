Hi, I'm interested in getting the list for license plate numbers. If anyone
has a listing I'd appreciate getting a copy of it. Thanks!
You can go to the DMV and ask for their listing. Although I
don't know where you may actually buy a copy, you can use theirs
for your perusal. In California, the listing of personalized
license plates run 3 volumes, each about 1.5" thick. I hope this
is what you're asking for.
