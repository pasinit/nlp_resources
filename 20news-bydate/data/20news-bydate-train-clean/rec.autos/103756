In a previous article, (Danny Phornprapha) says:
I have $30,000 as my budget. I'm looking for a sports or GT car.
What do you think would be the best buy? (I'm looking for specific models)
Thanks,
Danny

For an all out sports car, I'd go for the RX-7 without the sports
suspension (which is too stiff.) For a little more practicality and more
comfort, the Nissan 300ZX Turbo is a good buy. And for a good dose of
luxury, the Lexus SC300 is perfect (with a manual transmission of course.)
However, the Toyota Supra is coming out soon and if you like it's looks,
the performance is supposed to be great, almost race car like. I don't
particulary like the Mitsubishi 3000GT's or the Dodge Stealths as they are
too heavy and aren't very nimble handlers for a sports car.
