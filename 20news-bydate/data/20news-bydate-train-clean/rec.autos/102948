They were designed for speeds of upwards of 80 - I forget the
exact spec - but for military vehicles. That's 80 in a 1958 Dodge
Powerwagon. Not 80 in a 1993 Ford Taurus.
Ah yes, the 58 Powerwagon. Now there was a vehicle that today's cars can't
touch in terms of high speed road holding ability! :-)
