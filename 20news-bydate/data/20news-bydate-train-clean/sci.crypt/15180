The crypto-key disclosure issue hasn't come up yet, but current law

over the key.
It has actually come up (or it will in a week or two) in NZ. I'll post the
outcome when the trial finishes (which could take months BTW). Overall it
looks like you can't be forced to reveal a password, if anyone can provide
a convincing legal argument to the contrary (ie an actual court case) I'd
be most interested.
