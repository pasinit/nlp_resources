It was nice to see ESPN show game 1 between the Wings and Leafs since
the Cubs and Astros got rained out. Instead of showing another baseball
game, they decided on the Stanley Cup Playoffs. A classy move by ESPN.
They tried their best not to show it, believe me. I'm surprised they
couldn't find a sprint car race (mini cars through pigpens, indeed!)
on short notice.
