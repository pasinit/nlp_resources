I haven't seen anything about it yet, but if it's already been mentioned I'm
sorry for the repost. Anyways, TNN is showing Daytona on Sunday April 18
at 7:00pm to 8:30pm (EST). Don't miss it. It's got a hell of a finish!
Well, I looked for it and didn't manage to find it in my listings for TNN. Has
anybody taped it VHS, and could they be persuaded to lend it to me after they
watch it? I would be most greatful.
