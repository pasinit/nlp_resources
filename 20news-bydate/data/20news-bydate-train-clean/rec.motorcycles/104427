If your primary concern is protecting the passenger in the event of a
crash, have him or her fitted for a helmet that is their size. If your
primary concern is complying with stupid helmet laws, carry a real big
spare (you can put a big or small head in a big helmet, but not in a
small one).
So what should I carry if I want to comply with intelligent helmet laws?
(The above comment in no way implies support for any helmet law, nor should
such support be inferred. A promise is a promise.)
