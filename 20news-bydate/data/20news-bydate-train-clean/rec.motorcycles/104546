I was just wondering if there were any law officers that read this. I have
several questions I would like to ask pertaining to motorcycles and cops.
And please don't say get a vehicle code, go to your local station, or obvious
things like that. My questions would not be found in those places nor
answered face to face with a real, live in the flesh, cop.
If your brother had a friend who had a cousin whos father was a cop, etc.
don't bother writing in. Thanks.
I just gotta ask. What ARE these questions you want to ask an active cop?
Working on your DoD qualfications? B-)
