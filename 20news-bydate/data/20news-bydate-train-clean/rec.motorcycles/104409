The other day, it was raining cats and dogs, therefor I was going only to
the speed limit, on nothing more, on my bike. This guy in his BMW was
driving 1-2 meters behind me for 7-800 meters and at the next red light I
calmly put the bike on its leg, walked back to this car, he rolled down the
window, and I told him he was a total idiot (and the reason why).
Did I do the right thing?
Absolutely, unless you are in the U.S. Then the cager will pull a gun
and blow you away.
