The question for the day is re: passenger helmets, if you don't know for
certain who's gonna ride with you (like say you meet them at a . church
meeting, yeah, that's the ticket). What are some guidelines? Should I just
pick up another shoei in my size to have a backup helmet (XL), or should I
maybe get an inexpensive one of a smaller size to accomodate my likely
passenger?
If your primary concern is protecting the passenger in the event of a
crash, have him or her fitted for a helmet that is their size. If your
primary concern is complying with stupid helmet laws, carry a real big
spare (you can put a big or small head in a big helmet, but not in a
small one).
