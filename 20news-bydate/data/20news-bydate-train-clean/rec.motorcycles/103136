IF you can remember to tuck properly, the bits that are going to take most
punishment with the gear you have will probably be your feet, then hips and
knees. Get boots then trousers. The gloves come last, as long as you've the
self control to pull your arms in when you tuck. If not, get good gloves
first - Hands are VERY easily wrecked if you put one down to steady your
fall at 70mph!! The other bits heal easier.
Once you are fully covered, you no longer tuck, just lie back and enjoy the
ride.
