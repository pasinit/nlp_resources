If Good Sam got 300 bricks, delivered
first class postage to their door, at their expense, I bet they would change
their policies about mailing lists or about who can use their facilities
quickly.
And if the Lord God Almighty parted the sky and make a personal
appearance at their Board of Directors meeting, they would also change
their policies. The odds are about equal.
I am curious as to how many bricks I will have to send before this situatiion
is cleared up to my satisfaction. I suspect about 5. We shall see.
You'll be extremely lucky if you ever get one through.
