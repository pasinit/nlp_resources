Hi folks!
Recently saw one post about KREME being a *bad idea*, but that was only
one man's opinion.
Any one else have any experience with the stuff?
On my 59 sporty I had some pinhole leaks open up on the back seam. I kreme
it about a year ago and have had no problems at all. Be real careful as
the cleaning part of the solution is hell on paint.
