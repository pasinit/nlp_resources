Now maybe this isn't a big deal to some of you, but it is to me. I was raised
in the South, and part of my cultural heritage is waving at passersby. I
waved from the side of the road at passing cars, when I drove I waved or
nodded or at least raised an index finger from the steering wheel. People
waved at me as I drove by.
I was raised in the South, and I can attest that this is true. Why, on
one particularly hot day, as I was walking along the road, some good
ole boys in a truck tossed me a cold beer! Of course, they were going
50 mph at the time.
P.S. To prove this wasn't a fluke, it happened to me again when I was out
riding on Wednesday: an unsolicited wave. Wow.
Bikers wave to bikers the world over. Whether or not Harley riders
wave to other bikers is one of our favorite flame wars.
