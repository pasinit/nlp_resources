Before I repond to 2.), Andy, please clarify 1.). You state that
proteins did not form randomly. That seems to be my point.
Well, I am not Andy, but if you had familiarized yourself with some of
the current theories/hypotheses about abiogenesis before posting :-), you
would be aware of the fact that none of them claims that proteins were
assembled randomly from amino acids. It is current thinking that RNA-
based replicators came before proteinaceous enzymes, and that proteins
were assembled by some kind of primitive translation machinery.
Now respond to 2. :-)
