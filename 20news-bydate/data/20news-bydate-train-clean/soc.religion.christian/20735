Jeff Fenholt claims to have once been a roadie for Black Sabbath.
He was never ever a musician in the band. He was in St. Louis several
months back. The poster I saw at the Christian bookstore I frequent
really turned me off. It was addressed to all "Homosexuals, prostitutes,
drug addicts, alcoholics, and headbangers." or something like that.
Well, if I showed up with my long hair and black leather jacket I
would have felt a little pre-judged.
I have seen Jeff Fenholt speak and I didn't find him judgemental. I think
that the wording for that add was certainly inappropriate, but I think they
were trying to say that headbangers would like the program. But I would
NOT put headbangers in the same class as alcholics, etc. it is
condescending. And I believe that Jeff was wearing black when I saw him.
By the way, Fenholt played Jesus in Jesus Christ Superstar.
Personally, I'm a headbanger at times too, but I have a hard time with what
most of the secular metal groups promote. Free sex and drugs (my opinion
that many promote these) aren't my thing. I HAVE found several good
Christian metal groups that I like.
