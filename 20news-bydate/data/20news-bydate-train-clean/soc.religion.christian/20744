I may be wrong, but wasn't Jeff Fenholt part of Black Sabbath? He's a
MAJOR brother in Christ now. He totally changed his life around, and
Why should he have been any different "then"? Ozzy Osbourne,
ex-singer and main character of the Black Sabbath of good ole days past,
is and always was a devout catholic. Or so I've heard over on the
alt.rock-n-roll.metal newsgroups, an' I figure those folks oughta know.
