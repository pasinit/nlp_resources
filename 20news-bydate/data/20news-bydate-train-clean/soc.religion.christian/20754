I would like to get your opinions on this: when exactly does an engaged
couple become "married" in God's eyes?
Not if they are unwilling to go through a public marriage ceremony,
nor if they say they are willing but have not actually done so.
Let's distinguish _real_ logistical problems (like being stranded on a
desert island) from _excuses_ (such as waiting for so-and-so's brother
to come back from being in the army so he can be in the ceremony).
