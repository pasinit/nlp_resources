I have an IBM and run Windows 3.1. A friend installed Norton Desktop For
Windows on top of this. It loads automatically when I type "win", and
surely adds to the (already dismally slow) process of starting up.
I would like to know how to STOP or uninstall this program!!
Is there anyone familiar with NDW who can tell me how to turn it off??
1. Get the friend to uninstall it.
2. Read the manual (though from your post I infer that you are using
pirated software.)
