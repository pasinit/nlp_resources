There was a very useful article in one of the 1989 issues of
Transactions On Graphics. I believe Maureen Stone was one of
the authors. Sorry not to be more specific. I don't have the
reference here with me.
Stone, DeRose: Geometric characterization of parametric cubic curves.
ACM Trans. Graphics 8 (3) (1989) 147 - 163.
Manocha, Canny: Detecting cusps and inflection points in curves.
Computer aided geometric design 9 (1992) 1-24.
