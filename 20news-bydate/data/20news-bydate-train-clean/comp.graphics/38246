I am looking for an algorithm to determine if a given point is bound by a
polygon. Does anyone have any such code or a reference to book containing
information on the subject ?
See the article "An Efficient Ray-Polygon Intersection," p. 390 in
Graphics Gems (ISBN 0-12-286165-5). The second step, intersecting the
polygon, does what you want. There is sample code in the book.
