I must agree. There is a dizzying number of c.s.amiga.* newsgroups
already. In addition, there are very few issues which fall cleanly
into one of these categories.
Also, it is readily observable that the current spectrum of amiga
groups is already plagued with mega-crossposting; thus the group-split
would not, in all likelihood, bring about a more structured
environment.

Maybe I should point out that we are not talking about c.s.amiga.*.
Only comp.graphics.
