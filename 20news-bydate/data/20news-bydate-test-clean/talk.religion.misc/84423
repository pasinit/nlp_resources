[Discussion on Josephus inserts]
Thanks. Am I correct, then, in assuming that that Josephus
did in fact write about Jesus, but Christian copists embellished it?

That is indeed the present consensus. Contrary to what Dr. Fox has
been saying, however, present consensus is *not* that the longer
passage in Josephus about Jesus was inserted, but only that it was
modified.
There is no question that it was *at least* modified (based on what
Origen says--that Josephus did not recognize Jesus as the Messiah), but
I don't think the argument that it appears "out of context" is a very
good one. (I haven't looked at the context for a while; perhaps somebody
could give some of the sentences which precede and follow the Jesus
passage.)
