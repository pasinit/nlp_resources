Faith and intelligence tell me that when a druggie breaks into my house at
night with a knife to kill me for the $2 in my wallet, a .357 is considerably
more persuasive than having devotions with him.
.in other words faith in a .357 is far stronger than faith in a
God providing a miracle for his followers. Interesting. Now, if
David Korresh was God, why couldn't he use lightning instead of
semi-automatic rifles? It seems even he didn't trust in himself.
Cheers,
Kent
