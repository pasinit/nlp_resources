Even if what you say is true, do you think this is a reasonable way
to deal with people who want "lots of illegal guns"?
What makes you say that the guns were illegal?? I understand that the BD's
had a valid Class III Federal Firearms Permit, which would allow them to
have pretty much anything short of a howitzer legally.
