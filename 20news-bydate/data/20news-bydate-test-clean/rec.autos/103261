nice theory. too bad the MR2's never came with a four cylinder over 2.0
liters. More like 1.6. Or did they? were the nonturbo MR2II's 2.2 or
some such?
let me clarify, i think they both are 2.0 litres.
I also understand that anyone using balancing shafts on four cylinders, must
pay SAAB a royalty for using their patented design.like Porsche's 3.0 I4.
i was already corrected on this, and believe i may have been in errror, that
it is actually MISTUBISHI.
apologies for butting into the thread.
