RADAR (Radio Association Defending Airwave Rights) says that Geico
insurance not only buy's Radar for police but also actively lobbies
states to promote making Radar Detectors illegal. I think the
buying part is a misuse of money but the Radar Detector part shows
how little they know about the issue. No study I am aware of has ever
concluded that detectors have a negative impact on safety or that
users have a higher average speed. Incompetence by Geico? I think
so.
