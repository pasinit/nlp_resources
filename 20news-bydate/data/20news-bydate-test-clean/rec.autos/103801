Whoa! Watch your terminology. "Dealer invoice" is *not* "dealer cost".
.
That's probably true but it's the closest to it that you're going to get.
The actual dealer cost depends on a lot of things and even the dealer
probably doesn't know exactly what it will be until all the factory
kick-backs, incentives, etc. are paid and that often depends on his volume
at the end of the month/quarter/whatever. It might be a funny munber but
it's all you have to start with, except the sticker, and anyone who pays
sticker price is really being ripped off.
