Critisism is too easy. What solutions do people have that would have been

For starters, they could have gone on waiting and negotiating. The Davidians
weren't going anywhere, and their supplies had to be limited. Large, perhaps,
but limited. If they had simply fired the compound by themselves without
gov't tanks smashing down their walls, then at least the gov't would not be
guilty of having _again_ used an inappropriate level of force, and would have
been able to use the meantime to continue to pressure and negotiate. No, they
would not have looked good on the news in six months or a year. But they sure
as hell don't look very good now.
