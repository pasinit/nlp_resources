Because the Gun loonies were firing on vehicles with 50mm amunition that
has a range of 3000 meters.
What crap, Phil. 50mm? Wrong. To give you a clue as to how big 50mm is, the
F-16 fighter aircraft have 20mm gattling guns used to shoot down other
aircraft. A 50mm gun would be somewhere in the `cannon' realm. They might
have had .50 calibre but definitely not 50mm.
