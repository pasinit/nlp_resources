"IT IS A MATTER OF LOGIC that government-run systems are
inefficient, and the fact that the highly bureaucratized private
sector system in the US is vastly more inefficient is therefore
irrelevant.
Proof that the entire private sector is vastly more inefficient?
It is, for example, of no relevance that Blue Cross
of Massachusetts employs 6680 people, more than are employed in
all of Canada's health programs, which insure 10 times as many
people"
Blue Cross is the government health insurance provider.
Oops.
