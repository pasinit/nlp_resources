Football can pay for itself.
:Then there's the impact on Ross Perot's fortune of eliminating the various
state supported programs where he's made his money.
Why? He's already made it. Sure nodoby else will be able to bilk

:All in all, Texas doesn't seem to be a very likely place for
:libertarianism to take hold. :-)
More likely than most places. When I was there the most "important"
state issue was whether to have a state income tax or instead legalize
a popular vice for fund raising, and vice won a decisive victory!
