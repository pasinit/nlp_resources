What crap, Phil. 50mm? Wrong. To give you a clue as to how big 50mm is, the
F-16 fighter aircraft have 20mm gattling guns used to shoot down other
aircraft. A 50mm gun would be somewhere in the `cannon' realm. They might
have had .50 calibre but definitely not 50mm.
I think that Phil needs to get out a ruler and see exactly how big 50mm rounds
are - roughly 2" diameter. The type of stuff used in Anti-Aircraft gunnery.
.50 calibre is much smaller, but the 3000m effective range (~2mi) sounds about
right. Maybe he just got the two confused. The FBI's reasoning was sound,
but the note from PH-B was factually wrong.
