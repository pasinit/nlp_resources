I don't know about you, but I have nearly forgotten how to generate paper
mail.
If I had e-mail to Congress, I would have written many letters by now.
I haven't written one yet, as it turns out. Writing on paper is such
a complicated job, for those of us hooked on our way-cool Internet.
That's what MCI Mail is for! (CompuServe also has "CongressGrams" (TM).)
This is not intended as an advertisement; that really is what MCI Mail WAS
intended for (according to their ads).
