Quoting in article <>:
You would have to use something other than the AT&T black box - in other
words, I don't think public key would work. The session key would have
to be agreed upon prior to the conversation and distributed to all
sites beforehand.
Why can't one site decide a session key and send it to the other sites
by public key encryption?
