True, but the basic idea behind any communications security system is not
to absolutely deny access, but to make access more expensive (in time,
money, manpower) than it is worth.
Another idea: Use a laptop computer. As mentioned earlier, the LCD screen
is a lot less noisy than a standard CRT, but since many laptops have power
supplies that run at 3 volts instead of 5, they would be considerably
quieter.
