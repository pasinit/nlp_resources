Since the law requires that wiretaps be requested by the Executive
Branch and approved by the Judicial Branch, it seems clear that one
of the key registering bodies should be under the control of the
Judicial Branch. I suggest the Supreme Court, or, regionally, the
Courts of Appeal. More specifically, the offices of their Clerks.
Now THAT makes sense. But the other half must be in a non-government
escrow. (I still like EFF, but I admin their security has not been
tested.)
