This only makes sense if the government prohibits alternative non-escrowed
encryption schemes. Otherwise, why not just use the front end without
clipper?
Because everyone but you expects that making alternative methods of
encryption illegal is the next step. Otherwise the Cripple chip is
utterly worthless. It should be obvious that
a) the Cripple Chip is aimed at spying on ordinary citizens
OR
b) that other forms of encryption will soon be illegal.
