The NRA is successful because (among a number of things), on the drop of
a hat, they can get a congresspersons office flooded with postcards,

I don't know about you, but I have nearly forgotten how to generate paper

If I had e-mail to Congress, I would have written many letters by now.
I haven't written one yet, as it turns out. Writing on paper is such
a complicated job, for those of us hooked on our way-cool Internet.
