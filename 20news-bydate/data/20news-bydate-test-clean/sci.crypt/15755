No, because the Feds will still be able to decrypt the conversations.
True, they'll blame the wrong guys, but nevertheless one cannot say
something like "The drugs arrive tommorrow on the ship 'Terminus'"
when the Feds are listening, even if they cannot identify who the
speaker is.
It's not a question just of who is holding the phone. It's a question of
what circuit to wiretap in the first place. If two drug dealers are both
using stolen cellular phones, the FBI doesn't know which lines to tap
-- unless of course they're tapping *all* phones (maybe *all* cellular
phones). If they haven't tapped the connection (ie., at least one end of
the connection) then they don't know what key to request.
