I light of yesterday's events in Waco, Texas I guess the answer to your
questions are very obvious. If you think Waco is just one example think
back to 1972 in Jonestown where more than 900 people died for a lie.
Deletions.
Correction. I think it was 1978. Also, contrary to earlier belief, it
is now widely accepted that not all committed suicide, but were actually
killed. In the end, they did die for a lie, but some not out of
conviction alone. Thought I try to make this point clear.
