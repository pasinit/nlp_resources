Well here's how I prepared. I got one of those big beach
umbrellas, some of those gel-pack ice things, a big Coleman cooler
which I've loaded up with Miller Draft (so I like Miller Draft,
so sue me), a new pair of New Balance sneakers, a Sony
Watchman, and a couple of cartons of BonTon Cheddar Cheese
Popcorn.
I haven't decided what to wear yet. What does one wear to an
eternal damnation?

You should wear your nicest boxer shorts and bring plenty of SPF 45+
sunscreen. I'll grab my bathing suit, towerl and some veggie hotdogs and we
can have bonfire cookout!!
Does that sound good enough to you, Dean?
