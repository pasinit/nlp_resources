As a final note, the Oriental Orthodox and Eastren Orthodox did sign
a common statement of Christology, in which the heresey of Monophysitism
was condemned. So the Coptic Orthodox Church does not believe in
Monophysitism.
This is a point that seems to have been overlooked by many. The ending of a
1600 year old schism seems to be in sight.
The theologians said that the differences between them were fundamentally
ones or terminology, and that the Christological faith of both groups was
the same.
Some parishes have concelebrated the Eucharist, and here in Southern Africa
we are running a joint theological training course for Coptic and Byzantine
Orthodox.
There are still several things to be sorted out, however. As far as the
Copts are concerned, there were three ecumenical councils, whily the
Byzantine Orthodox acknowledge seven.
