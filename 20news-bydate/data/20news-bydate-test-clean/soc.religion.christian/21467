Since Mary was free from 'original sin' she
did not exactly die: 'at the end of her life'
(as the dogmatic prounouncement says) she
was assumed into heaven.
The dogma of the Assumption does not state whether or not Mary died a
physical death before being taken into Heaven. Catholics are free to
believe what they wish, whether it be that she was taken still alive, or
after having died. I lean somewhat toward the latter myself.
