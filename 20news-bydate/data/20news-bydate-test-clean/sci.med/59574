The charter for misc.health.diabetes appears below.
--------------------------
Charter:
misc.health.diabetes unmoderated
1. The purpose of misc.health.diabetes is to provide a forum for the
discussion of issues pertaining to diabetes management, i.e.: diet,
activities, medicine schedules, blood glucose control, exercise,
medical breakthroughs, etc. This group addresses the issues of
management of both Type I (insulin dependent) and Type II (non-insulin
dependent) diabetes. Both technical discussions and general support
discussions relevant to diabetes are welcome.
2. Postings to misc.heath.diabetes are intended to be for discussion
purposes only, and are in no way to be construed as medical advice.
Diabetes is a serious medical condition requiring direct supervision
by a primary health care physician.
