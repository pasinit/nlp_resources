A friend of mine (who's probably reading this right now) just bought a new
Yamaha Virago 750. After spending 1-2 hours very late one chilly evening
watching him struggle with the bolts (had to remove the right peg, loosen
the brake pedal, &c. &c.) I've pretty much decided never to get this
particular model unless he or someone else wants to change the oil/filter
for me. Compared to the 5-minute change he was used to for his Honda, this
is just a design flaw/oversight in my eyes.

Sure don't know what bike was being worked on but it sure wasn't a
Virago. I've owned both the 750 and 1100 and you can do the filter
change in about 5 mins and nothing has to be removed. Obviously the
"new" bike was modified as the stock machine is simple to work on.
Watching for imitators!!
