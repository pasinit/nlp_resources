Well maintained chains, running in oil, without those little rubber 'O' rings
to cause frictional losses, might reach 99% efficiency. The average open to
the dust 'O' ring motorcycle chain probably has a difficult job making 90%
efficient.
How about some sources for all these numbers? Or is this more stuff that
"everybody knows"?
