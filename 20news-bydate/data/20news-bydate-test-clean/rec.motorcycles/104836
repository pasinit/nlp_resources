Sure they are. Here we can buy:
GSXR250
CBR250
FZR250
The prob is that you're wrong.
Newbie here.
I just got off the phone with a salesman
that showed by newbieness.
If I remember what he said correctly:
GSXR250 - no such thing
CBR250 - NO. Its CB250.
FZR250 - no such thing.
Most sport bikes don't have 250 versions.
