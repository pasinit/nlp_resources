Don't feed it so much.
Seriously.

If you can't you've obviously waited too long, or are not putting
much effort into it.
MY 80 lb dog (not always) used to fart all the time.
By making her notice it (of course the smell doesn't
bother HER! :), and thence kicking her outside (somewhat
literally), she came to realize that she shoudln't do it
(at least not around me)
Sort of like that scene in "10", in the minister's study, when the
secretary lets one fly, and the startled dog runs from the room.
The minister explains, "Every time Mrs. Soandso breaks wind, we beat the dog."
