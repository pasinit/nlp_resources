Does anyone have any ideas that may be implemented to help prevent users from
losing sight of the cursor in an XTerm window under certain circumstances where
there are many screen-based fields.
What I would like to do is make the cursor flash on or off, but so far haven't
found a way of doing so. Has anybody else had similar problems or fixes to
make a cursor stand out more than the standard type.
Users can't find the cursor? Run "xneko" - it'll turn the cursor into a
mouse (rodent variety (-: ). If your users still can't find it, the cat will!
