I saw another post on this list (the subject was something like "Is vi
available for Windows?") in which someone said that vi, make, awk, and
***ksh*** was available with Microsoft TOOLKIT. What is that product? Is
it a separate product or part of Windows? ksh would do what I need if I
could count on it at all NT sites.
I imagine that was the MKS Toolkit, from Mortice Kern Systems.
Another third party add-in, and a good one too.
