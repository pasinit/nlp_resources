Hi there,
Could someone please suggest one of the better _shareware_
replacements for Win3.1's Program Manager and File Manager?
And which ftp site are they located at?
Thanks in advance for e-mail response.
Please post your response as well. I think many would be
interested in this one. Thank You.
