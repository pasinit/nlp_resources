I recently purchased a Diamond Stealth 24 ISA graphics accelerator card (based
upon a positive review by Steve Gibson of Infoworld). Although it's fast, I
find its windows drivers extremely buggy despite implementing all of the
Diamond technical support suggestions. Does anyone else have any experience
with this card?
Any feedback appreciated.
