Hi there,
I have a problem here, I've lost the software drivers and
setup programs for my Hardcard. Can someone email me the
files, or let me know if Plus Development (were they
bought out by Quantum?) has a BBS or phone #?
I have a Hardcard II XL50.
The Quantum BBS number is 408-894-3214. Good luck.
