I'm selling an Adaptec 1640 SCSI controller card. I works with Microchannel
machines only. The data transfer rate is very fast (I get about 3meg/sec with
my SCSI hard drive), and that's with relatively slow 100ns RAM on a card. It's
a SCSI-2 true bus mastering/DMA device, and goes for around $329 bought new.
I'm including the new EZ-SCSI software for speedy Win 3.1 performance and easy
configuration.
